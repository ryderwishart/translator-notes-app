He begins with how he created everything from nothing, including the earth and all the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, stars), all the plants and animals, and especially how he created human beings in his image to be in a relationship with him. This book also explains how sin and death came into the world and what God’s plan is to save people from that. In fact, all the important teachings in the Bible begin in Genesis. That makes this book **foundational** and important for everyone so that they can know and understand the truth about God and his plan for their lives.\n\nBeginning with verse 1, the book of Genesis is a **narrative** that tells the history of events that actually happened. This is confirmed by the fact that the conjunctions and the forms of the verbs that are used in the Hebrew text reflect the Hebrew narrative style, which is used to narrate historical accounts. In the same way, those who translate the book of Genesis should also use grammatical structures in their languages that are used for true, historical narratives. God uses narrative, which is one of the most interesting styles of communication, to not only tell people about the events in the early history of the world, but also to teach them about himself and about the way he interacts with people as their loving Creator.\n\nGenesis provides the **vital context** for the rest of God’s Word, especially the gospel message about Jesus, and so it helps people to understand their need for him to be their Savior. In fact, without Genesis, it would not be clear why everyone needs to trust in Jesus as the only one who can save them from sin and its consequences, so that they can associate with God and be part of his eternal family.\n\nIn light of all that, Genesis should be one of the first books of the Bible that is translated into every language that needs a translation. May God guide and bless you and your translation team as you undertake this important task together by his power.\n\n### Author and date of writing\n\nMoses was the human author of the first five books of the Bible, including the book of Genesis (Exodus 24:3-4; Deuteronomy 31:9, 24; John 1:45). The Holy Spirit is the one who inspired what Moses wrote in those books (2 Peter 1:21), so ultimately God is the author, and these books are part of his Message to mankind. Those five books are sometimes referred to as the Torah (a Hebrew word that means “teaching,” “instruction,” or “law”) or the Pentateuch (a Greek word that means “five books”). In the New Testament this set of books is also referred to as “the Law” (John 1:45) or “the Law of Moses” (Acts 28:23), and Jesus himself affirmed that Moses wrote them (John 5:46-47; 7:23).\n\nMoses was born in the country of Egypt around 1526 B.C. (Exodus 2:1-10). According to the genealogies in Genesis, his birth was about 1,000 years after the Flood (which was about 1,650 years after creation). Moses may have written much of the Pentateuch during the forty years that he led the people of Israel as they wandered in the wilderness (around 1446 B.C.—1406 B.C.).\n\nThe very first verse in Genesis assumes that God (the author guiding the human author) has always existed and that he has no beginning and no end (also see Genesis 21:33; Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2). He uses his personal name “Yahweh” for the first time in Genesis 2:4. The name “Yahweh” means “he is” and indicates that God is eternal. His name also means that he is unchanging and that he is always present.\n\n### Book outline\n\nIn all, Genesis covers a span of about 2200 years of history. After the world’s early history, the rest of Genesis tells about the ancestors of God’s people, with special focus on Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (and their families). Genealogies are an important part of what ties the book together from beginning to end.\n\nThe following outline shows these two main divisions in the book of Genesis: (1) Early World History, and (2) The History about the Ancestors of God’s Chosen People. Those two divisions each have roughly four main subdivisions, which are based on four key events (in the first division) and four key ancestors (in the second division). Some scholars prefer to divide the book up into ten divisions that are introduced by the Hebrew phrase that means “these are the generations of...” In the outline below, **asterisks** mark the sections that contain that phrase. The phrase is found in Genesis 2:4 (heavens and earth), 5:1 (Adam), 6:9 (Noah), 10:1, 32 (sons of Noah), 11:10 (Shem), 11:27 (Terah), 25:12 (Ishmael), 25:19 (Isaac),  36:1, 9 (Esau), and 37:2 (Jacob).\n\n**Bolded words** in the outline show which sections contain promises and covenants from God and also mark who the main ancestors were in the various sub-divisions.\n\n#### Division 1: Early World History\n\nCreation\n- God creates the universe and everything in it (1:1-2:3)\n- Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden (2:4-25)\\*\n\nThe Fall\n- The first sin and God’s judgment;

Many translations use a special format to identify these passages as poetry by indenting each clause on a new line. Many other translations do not do this, but rather use regular paragraph formatting everywhere, including for poetry. It may be helpful to look at a translation in the national language of your country that uses poetry formatting, to help you decide whether or not you want to do something similar in your translation. Some translations put some of the following passages in poetry format since these verses have certain features of poetry such as parallelisms and metaphors: Genesis 1:27; 2:23; 3:14-16, 17b-19; 4:23-24; 8:22; 9:6, 25-27; 12:2-3; 14:19-20; 15:1; 16:11-12; 24:60; 25:23; 27:27-29, 39-40; 48:15-16, 20; 49:1-27. You may not want to put all these passages in poetry format since some of them have parallelisms that are not necessarily poetry but may just be emphasizing certain events in the narrative or certain points in a prophecy.\n\n
1:intro	zb6f				0	### Possible titles for this book:\n\n\n- “Genesis”\n- “The Book of Genesis”\n- “Genesis: The First Book By Moses”\n- “Genesis: The Book About Beginnings”\n- “The First Book That God's Prophet/Spokesman Moses Wrote: Genesis”\n\n\nThe English title “Genesis” is a transliteration of a Greek word that means “origin” or “beginning” or “birth”; the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures (the Septuagint) uses this word for the first time in Genesis 2:4. The Hebrew title of this book בְּרֵאשִׁית (pronounced “bereshith”) is the first Hebrew word in verse 1 and literally means “In the beginning.” The Latin translation of the Bible (the Latin Vulgate) was the first translation to use the title “The Book of Genesis.” Since that time, many other translations include “Genesis” in the book title because people are familiar with that name. Sometimes as part of the title, translators also include the fact that Moses was the author and that he was inspired by God. Do what is best in your language.
1:1	uiu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠רֵאשִׁ֖ית	1	The first chapter of Genesis is a true historical narrative (which is indicated by the Hebrew language structures that are used throughout the chapter), and verse 1 records the first event in that history. This is confirmed by the wider context of the Scriptures, which teach us that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3). Some languages must use a verb (“began”) in verse 1 rather than an abstract noun (**beginning**). Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “At the beginning of time”
1:1	b730		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Translate the title **God** in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed.
1:1	hmtj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	בָּרָ֣א	1	In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter 1 is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. Alternate translation: “made”
1:1	bcu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֵ֥ת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יִם	1	This phrase refers here to the region where all the stars and planets would later exist. Keep that in mind as you translate this term. Alternate translation: “the sky”
1:1	wgq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וְ⁠אֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	This phrase refers to the planet earth.
1:2	qfra			וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ	1	The author pauses here to describe what the earth and the heavens were like after God first created them (verse 1). Some languages use a conjunction like **Now** to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated **the earth** in verse 1. Alternate translation: “Now at first after that, the earth”
1:2	btmf			הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֨הוּ֙ וָ⁠בֹ֔הוּ	1	It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate,” or “did not have its present form, and there was nothing living on it yet,” or (2) “completely empty/desolate,” which treats the text as a hendiadys. However, it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as they are in the Hebrew text).
1:2	f7a1			וְ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם	1	For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “It was completely dark, there was deep water everywhere,” or “There was deep water everywhere that was surrounded by total darkness,”
1:2	rp8q			וְ⁠ר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “and God’s Spirit was hovering/moving” or (2) “and a wind from God was blowing” or (3) “and a powerful wind was blowing”. The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb **hovering** does not describe what wind does.
1:2	yq4r			עַל פְּנֵ֥י הַ⁠מָּֽיִם	1	Throughout this chapter, the word **waters** is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water”. Do what is best in your language in each context. Alternate translation: “over the surface of the water.” or “above the waters”
1:3	kxuq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. Alternate translation: “Then God commanded,”
1:3	o0zd			יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר	1	This is a command, not a permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation point with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate **light** should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself. Alternate translation: “Let light exist.” or “I command there to be light.”
1:3	nj3u			וַֽ⁠יְהִי אֽוֹר	1	Light began to shine immediately as a result of God’s command. Alternate translation: “So immediately there was light.” or “And so light started shining.”
1:4	ceam		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as **And** or **Then** at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew uses conjunctions. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. Alternate translation: “And he saw” or “He saw”
1:4	bnvs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֶת הָ⁠א֖וֹר כִּי ט֑וֹב	1	In the Bible, **good** is an important theme. Throughout chapter 1, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. Alternate translation: “that the light was good”
1:4	wtmd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as **God**) and pronouns (such as “he”) are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, **God** is repeated frequently in chapter 1 to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say **God** only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter 1, do what is best in your language each time that you refer to God.
1:4	q3jo			וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠א֖וֹר וּ⁠בֵ֥ין הַ⁠חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	 Alternate translation: “Then he separated the light from the darkness so that each had its own time.” or “Then he caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time.” or “Then he separated the light from the darkness so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours.”
1:5	c9yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	Some languages omit the connecting word **And** or **Then** here. Consider what is the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. Alternate translation: “Then God called” or “God named”
1:5	cc8r			לָ⁠אוֹר֙ י֔וֹם	1	Notice that in this context the word **Day** refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter 1, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created. Do what is best in your language.
1:5	if7a			וְ⁠לַ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה	1	In the Hebrew text, **the darkness** is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider what is the best way to translate this clause in your language. Alternate translation: “and the darkness he called Nighttime.” or “and he named the darkness Nighttime.”
1:5	xxe6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” and would fit well here. Alternate translation: “Then evening came, and then morning came,”
1:5	xmx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד	1	Here **day** refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (**one**) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second,” “third,” and so on) for the rest of the days of the creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one,” “day two,” and so on). Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and that was day one.”
1:6	nesq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. Alternate translation: “Then God commanded,”
1:6	gqae			יְהִ֥י רָקִ֖יעַ	1	The Hebrew word for **expanse** here describes a large space that is “spread out.” It was not solid, but rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated **Let there be** in verse 3. Alternate translation: “Let there be a vast space” or “I command there to be a vast space” or “I command a vast space to form”
1:6	mscz			בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	See how you translated **waters** in verse 2.
1:6	c6kn			וִ⁠יהִ֣י מַבְדִּ֔יל בֵּ֥ין מַ֖יִם לָ⁠מָֽיִם	1	 Alternate translation: “and let it divide the water above it from the water below it.” or “so that it separates the waters into two different places.”
1:7	i8t2			וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִים֮	1	Verse 7 explains what God’s command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice. Alternate translation: “In that way God made” or “That is how he made”
1:7	dgya			אֶת הָ⁠רָקִיעַ֒	1	 Alternate translation: “a vast space”
1:7	c752			וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֗ל	1	 Alternate translation: “and divided” or “and used it to separate”
1:7	pidk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בֵּ֤ין הַ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ מִ⁠תַּ֣חַת לָ⁠רָקִ֔יעַ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר מֵ⁠עַ֣ל לָ⁠רָקִ֑יעַ	1	For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (**it**) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places, and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the water that was below the expanse from the water that was above it.” or “the water that was under it from the water that was above it.”
1:7	xfx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	 Alternate translation: “That is the way it happened.” or “Everything was exactly as he commanded it to be”
1:8	igd0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here (with or without a conjunction) or to continue the sentence that began at the end of verse 7. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 5. Alternate translation: “He called” or “and he called”
1:8	hh8a			לָֽ⁠רָקִ֖יעַ	1	See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 7. Alternate translation: “the vast space”
1:8	n336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth’s surface where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse 1.
1:8	su1z			וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	See how you translated this sentence in verse 5, and see the note about that there. Alternate translation: “Then evening came, and then morning came,”
1:8	adzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שֵׁנִֽי	1	Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number (**second**) here or a cardinal number (“two”). Alternate translation: “and the second day ended.” or “and that was the end of day two.”
1:9	yc3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	See how you translated this phrase in verses 3 and 6. Alternate translation: “Then God commanded,”
1:9	yetc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִקָּו֨וּ הַ⁠מַּ֜יִם מִ⁠תַּ֤חַת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙	1	Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb (**be gathered**) or an active form (“gather” or “come”). Alternate translation: “Let the water that is under the sky come together” or “I command the water that is below the heavens to come together”
1:9	as42			אֶל מָק֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	 Alternate translation: “in one area” or “into one area”
1:9	g8i2			וְ⁠תֵרָאֶ֖ה הַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁ֑ה	1	The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate **dry ground** does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water. Alternate translation: “so that there is dry land.” or “so that dry land can be seen.” or “so that land is uncovered and dries off.”
1:9	gign			וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	See how you translated this sentence in verse 7. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “And it was exactly as God commanded it to be”
1:10	eh2f			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	 Alternate translation: “Then he named”
1:10	khag			לַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁה֙	1	 Alternate translation: “the dry land” or “the land that had dried off”
1:10	teai			אֶ֔רֶץ	1	This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as “earth” in verse 1, but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), and not to the entire planet. Alternate translation: “Ground,”
1:10	c5av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְוֵ֥ה הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם קָרָ֣א	1	See how you translated a sentence in verse 5 that is similar in structure to this sentence. Alternate translation: “and the waters that he had gathered together he named” or “and he called the gathered waters” or “and he called the waters that had come together”
1:10	sb47			יַמִּ֑ים	1	At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large land mass on the earth (as verse 9 indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as “Ocean” or “Sea”, could be used here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Oceans.”
1:10	gnuy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Decide whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun (**God**) or a pronoun (**he**) in this context. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4. Alternate translation: “And he saw” or “He saw”
1:10	hk8y			כִּי טֽוֹב	1	Some languages cannot use a pronoun (**it**) here, but have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the word **good** in verse 4, and see the note about that there. Alternate translation: “that what he had made was good” or “that the land and the seas were good”
1:11	jq0c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	 Alternate translation: “Then God commanded,”
1:11	lnyu			תַּֽדְשֵׁ֤א הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙ דֶּ֔שֶׁא	1	The Hebrew word for **vegetation** refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse. Also, see how you translated “Land” in verse 10. Alternate translation: “I command the ground to grow green plants,” or “The ground must now be covered with green plants,”
1:11	sdob			עֵ֚שֶׂב מַזְרִ֣יעַ זֶ֔רַע	1	This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn, and wheat. Alternate translation: “including every kind of plant that has seeds” or “including all kinds of plants that have seeds”
1:11	cv1n			עֵ֣ץ פְּרִ֞י עֹ֤שֶׂה פְּרִי֙ לְ⁠מִינ֔⁠וֹ	1	The phrase **according to its kind** emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds. Alternate translation: “and fruit trees that bear fruit, each according to its own kind” or “and every kind of fruit tree that bears its own kind of fruit” or “and all kinds of fruit trees that bear their own kind of fruit”
1:11	o8kh			אֲשֶׁ֥ר זַרְע⁠וֹ ב֖⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “that has seeds inside,” or “with its own kind of seeds inside it,”
1:11	k8cn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “Let the land sprout vegetation on/throughout the earth …” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “throughout the earth.”
1:11	virt			וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that verse 12 gives the details of what happened. This is different from verse 7, where the details of what happened come before **And it was so**, and from verse 9, where no additional details are given. Alternate translation: “And it happened exactly as God commanded it to happen:”
1:12	jikr			וַ⁠תּוֹצֵ֨א הָ⁠אָ֜רֶץ דֶּ֠שֶׁא	1	Verse 12 explains what God’s command in verse 11 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice. Alternate translation: “The land sprouted plants,” or “The land started growing green plants,”
1:12	rh5y			עֵ֣שֶׂב מַזְרִ֤יעַ זֶ֨רַע֙ לְ⁠מִינֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	 Alternate translation: “including plants that have seeds, each according to its own kind” or “including every kind of plant that has seeds that grow into the same type of plant,” or “including all kinds of plants that have their own type of seeds,”

1:12	o8er		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction. Alternate translation: “And he saw” or “He saw”
1:12	k58u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּי טֽוֹב	1	See how you translated this clause in verse 10. Some languages have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “that what he had made was good” or “that all the plants and trees were good”
1:13	b3dy			וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	See how you translated this sentence in verses 5 and 8. Alternate translation: “Then evening came, and then morning came,”
1:13	xcdg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שְׁלִישִֽׁי	1	 Alternate translation: “and the third day ended.” or “and that was the end of day three.”
1:14	h9x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	 Alternate translation: “Then God commanded,”
1:14	f6qj			יְהִ֤י מְאֹרֹת֙	1	These lights refer to the sun, moon and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights. Alternate translation: “Let lamps exist” or “Let there be objects that give light”
1:14	snjr			בִּ⁠רְקִ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	The expanse is the same thing as the heavens (verse 8), so some translations leave **the expanse of** implied here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “in the space of the sky” or “in the open space of the sky” or “in the heavens”
1:14	as7i			לְ⁠הַבְדִּ֕יל	1	 Alternate translation: “to divide” or “that separate”
1:14	ik3v			בֵּ֥ין הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה	1	See how you translated “Daytime” and “Nighttime” in verse 5.
1:14	iva1			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙	1	 Alternate translation: “Let those lamps also be” or “They will also serve as” or “I also command those lamps to serve as”
1:14	kwpn			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “signs/markers of special/important events, and they must/will mark” or “They must/will also mark/indicate when important things happen, and they must/will mark/show” or (2) “signs/markers that mark/indicate/show”. The word **signs** means that the lights are to mark certain times of the year. Following the first interpretation, the lights are to also mark special events (such as the star that signaled Jesus’ birth and the darkened sun at Jesus’ death).
1:14	zf63			וּ⁠לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים וּ⁠לְ⁠יָמִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁנִֽים	1	The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. Seasons are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis 8:22), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
1:15	qfvm			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לִ⁠מְאוֹרֹת֙	1	 Alternate translation: “And they will be sources of light” or “They will serve as lights” or “Their purpose is to serve as sources of light”

1:15	jf98			לְ⁠הָאִ֖יר עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	See how you translated **the earth** in verses 1-2. Alternate translation: “to shine light on the earth.” or “so that they give light to the earth.”

1:16	slgo			וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Verses 16-18 explain what God’s commands in verses 14-15 caused to happen. Make sure your translation of these verses does not sound like he created the lights twice. See how you translated **So God made** in verse 7. Alternate translation: “In that way God made” or “That is how he made”
1:16	axyb			אֶת שְׁנֵ֥י הַ⁠מְּאֹרֹ֖ת הַ⁠גְּדֹלִ֑ים	1	This phrase refers to the sun and the moon, which are the two brightest objects in the earth’s sky. However, the author intentionally does not use their names, so you should not include their names in your translation either. Alternate translation: “the two big lights,”
1:16	udou			אֶת הַ⁠מָּא֤וֹר הַ⁠גָּדֹל֙	1	The focus is on the relative brightness or strength of the lights, not on their size. Alternate translation: “the stronger light”
1:16	vq3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לְ⁠מֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	The word **rule** is a figure of speech that means each light has the greatest effect during a particular time period because it is the brightest light that is shining then. For some languages, nonliving objects like the sun and the moon cannot **rule** because only people can do that. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to govern the day,”
1:16	slw4			וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠מָּא֤וֹר הַ⁠קָּטֹן֙	1	 Alternate translation: “and the dimmer light”
1:16	kas2			לְ⁠מֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת הַ⁠לַּ֔יְלָה	1	Be consistent here with how you translated **rule** previously in this verse. Alternate translation: “to govern the night,”
1:16	vlll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֵ֖ת הַ⁠כּוֹכָבִֽים	1	The verb **made** that is used earlier in the verse is implied here. Translate this in a way that is clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and he also made the stars.” or “That is also when he created the stars.”
1:17	wi1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֥ן אֹתָ֛⁠ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Consider what is the best way in your language to refer to God and the lights at this point in the paragraph. Alternate translation: “God put them” or “God placed the lights”

Also see how you translated **rule** in 1:16. Alternate translation: “and to dominate the daytime or the nighttime,” or “and to shine during the daytime and during the nighttime,”
1:18	x9y4			וּֽ⁠לֲ⁠הַבְדִּ֔יל בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠א֖וֹר וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠חֹ֑שֶׁךְ	1	Consider again how you translated **separate** in verses 4, 6-7, 14 and 18. Alternate translation: “and to distinguish the light from the darkness.” or “and to separate the time of light from the time of darkness.”

1:20	szof			וְ⁠עוֹף֙ יְעוֹפֵ֣ף	1	The Hebrew word for **birds** can also be more general and refer to “winged/flying creatures,” which includes birds, bats, flying insects and even flying reptiles that are now extinct. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “and let there be birds that fly” or “Also let there be winged creatures that fly”
1:20	obps			עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ עַל פְּנֵ֖י רְקִ֥יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	 Alternate translation: “above the earth, through the air.” or “across the sky above the earth.”

1:21	yks1			לְ⁠מִֽינֵ⁠הֶ֗ם	1	This phrase emphasizes that each different kind of creature has its own distinct kind of offspring/young.

Alternate translation: “each according to its own kind” or “each that has its own kind of young,”
1:21	w4mh			וְ⁠אֵ֨ת	1	For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, so that the previous sentence is not too long. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and how he made” or “That is also how he created”

1:22	tv0s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְבָ֧רֶךְ אֹתָ֛⁠ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	For some languages it is necessary to specify what **them** refers to. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Then God caused them all to prosper” or “Then God blessed the water creatures and the birds”
1:22	yiar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	God blesses the water animals first. If that is not clear, you could make that explicit here in the quote margin or at the beginning of what God says. Alternate translation: “and said first to the water animals,”
1:22	v2ge		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	פְּר֣וּ	1	God speaks directly to the water animals using the second person (“you”), then later in the verse speaks about the birds in the third person (**the birds**).

1:22	pfl8			אֶת הַ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙ בַּ⁠יַּמִּ֔ים	1	For some languages, “water in the seas” is too repetitive, so it is more natural here to just say “seas/sea” or “ocean” or “water”. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “the water of the sea”
1:22	wysn			וְ⁠הָ⁠ע֖וֹף יִ֥רֶב	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated **multiply** earlier in this verse. Alternate translation: “And the birds will also increase greatly in number” or “You birds will also become very many”

1:24	lpze			בְּהֵמָ֥ה	1	This term probably includes animals such as horses, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats that people raise for food or use for farming or other work. This is in contrast to animals that normally live in the wild. Alternate translation: “including farm animals,”

Some languages have to specify who is being spoken to. Do what is best in your language.
1:26	blpi			נַֽעֲשֶׂ֥ה	1	Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (**us** and **our**) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible. Alternate translation: “Now we will make”
1:26	bahl			אָדָ֛ם	1	The Hebrew word for **man** is used here (and in verse 27) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including both male and female. Alternate translation: “mankind”

1:26	fiz0			וּ⁠בְ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם	1	Some translations leave out the phrase **of the sky** because it is strongly implied and may not sound natural in their languages. However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky. Alternate translation: “the birds that fly in the sky”
1:26	qqil			וּ⁠בַ⁠בְּהֵמָה֙	1	Consider again how you translated **livestock** in verses 24-26. Alternate translation: “the farm animals,”

1:27	yyg0			בְּ⁠צַלְמ֔⁠וֹ	1	God made mankind to be like himself in some ways (not all ways) and to represent him in the world and show people what he is like. For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation. You could include some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “in his own image.” or “to be similar to himself in many ways.”
1:27	f9uj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠צֶ֥לֶם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בָּרָ֣א אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to the collective noun **man**, which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person. Also, this clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of verse 27 in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God’s image that human beings were created. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Yes he made them in his image” or “Indeed he created them to be like himself” or “Yes, God made them to be similar to himself in many ways”
1:27	n054			זָכָ֥ר וּ⁠נְקֵבָ֖ה בָּרָ֥א אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	The phrase **male and female** comes first in the Hebrew text in order to emphasize it. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Also make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like God is both male and female. Alternate translation: “He also made them to be male or female.”
1:28	n52a			וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֹתָ⁠ם֮ אֱלֹהִים֒	1	See how you translated **blessed** in verse 22. Alternate translation: “Then God showed his favor to them” or “Then God caused them to prosper”
1:28	mnzd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֜ם אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation of this quote margin that what God says next is the way that he blessed mankind, not something he said separately from that. Alternate translation: “and said,” or “He said,”
1:28	lyey			פְּר֥וּ	1	See how you translated **Be fruitful and multiply** in verse 22. It may be necessary to translate the phrase in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “Bear many children” or “You will bear many children”
1:28	xie5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	וּ⁠רְב֛וּ	1	 Alternate translation: “so that you and your descendants will multiply greatly in number” or “so that you and your descendants will become very many”
1:28	lpep			וּ⁠מִלְא֥וּ אֶת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and inhabit the whole earth” or “Fill the earth”
1:28	g9jo			וְ⁠כִבְשֻׁ֑⁠הָ	1	 Alternate translation: “and take care of it.” or “and bring it under your control.”
1:28	c3f8			וּ⁠רְד֞וּ	1	See how you translated **rule** in verse 26. Alternate translation: “You must rule over” or “I am giving you authority to rule”
1:28	prup			בִּ⁠דְגַ֤ת הַ⁠יָּם֙ וּ⁠בְ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	See how you translated these phrases in verse 26. Alternate translation: “the fish in the ocean, the birds that fly in the sky”
1:28	ytrg			וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל חַיָּ֖ה הָֽ⁠רֹמֶ֥שֶׂת עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	This phrase refers generally here to every kind of creature that lives on land. Alternate translation: “and every animal that moves on the land.” or “and all the animals that move on the land.”
1:29	sqcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add “also” to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However, the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best. Alternate translation: “Then God also said to them,” or “Then he added,”
1:29	a4r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	הִנֵּה֩	1	This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention. Consider what is the best way to translate this term in your language. Alternate translation: “Look,” or “Listen to this,” or “I want you to know that”
1:29	uvuf			נָתַ֨תִּי לָ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	 Alternate translation: “I am now giving to you as food” or “I have provided as food for you” or “I am now providing as food for you”
1:29	oakn			אֶת כָּל עֵ֣שֶׂב זֹרֵ֣עַ זֶ֗רַע אֲשֶׁר֙	1	See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12. Alternate translation: “every kind of seed-bearing plant that grows” or “every kind of plant with seeds that grows” or “all the different kinds of plants that yield seeds and grow”

1:30	h154			וּֽ⁠לְ⁠כָל חַיַּ֣ת הָ֠⁠אָרֶץ	1	See how you translated similar phrases in verses 24 and 25. Alternate translation: “In the same way, to every kind of wild creature that lives on the land,” or “Likewise, to all the wild creatures that live on the land,” or “In the same way, to all the wild animals,”
1:30	cxyb			וּ⁠לְ⁠כָל ע֨וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֜יִם	1	 Alternate translation: “and every kind of bird that flies in the sky,”
1:30	n7vq			וּ⁠לְ⁠כֹ֣ל רוֹמֵ֣שׂ עַל הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁר בּ⁠וֹ֙ נֶ֣פֶשׁ חַיָּ֔ה	1	See how you translated “that moves on the earth” in verse 28. Alternate translation: “and every other kind of creature that moves on the land and has the breath of life,” or “and all the other creatures that move on the earth and breathe air to live,”
1:30	hifc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֶת כָּל יֶ֥רֶק עֵ֖שֶׂב לְ⁠אָכְלָ֑ה	1	For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse and say, “In the same way, I give every type of green plant for food to all the wild animals that live on the earth, and all the birds that fly in the sky, and all the other animals that live on the land and breathe air.” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated **plant** in verses 11, 12, 29. Alternate translation: “I give every kind of green plant as food.” or “I have given all the green plants as food.”
1:30	ivkg			וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	Consider again how you translated this sentence in verses 7, 9, 11, 15, 24 and 30. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context. For example, here in verse 30 this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command. Alternate translation: “And it was exactly as God said it would be.”
1:31	hhg6			וַ⁠יַּ֤רְא אֱלֹהִים֙	1	See how you translated “God saw …” in verse 4. Alternate translation: “Then God observed”
1:31	c85e			אֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה	1	This phrase refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated **made** (or “make”) in verses 7, 16, 25, 26 and 31. Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning (“created”) in verses 1, 21 and 27. Alternate translation: “everything that he had created,”
1:31	w4pz			וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good. Alternate translation: “and indeed” or “and he saw that”
1:31	uixn			ט֖וֹב מְאֹ֑ד	1	Consider again how you translated “good/excellent” in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, and 31. Alternate translation: “it was all very good”
1:31	pjit			וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Consider again how you translated these phrases in verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, and 31, and see the note about that at verse 5. Alternate translation: “Then evening came, and then morning came,”
1:31	vsiy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם הַ⁠שִּׁשִּֽׁי	1	 Alternate translation: “and the sixth day ended.” or “and that was the end of day six.”
2:1	alnx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יְכֻלּ֛וּ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֥יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	Verse 1 is a summary statement that looks back at what God did in chapter 1. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here, and see how you translated “heavens and earth” in Gen 1:1. Alternate translation: “So it was that the heavens and the earth were finished by God,” or “That is how God finished making the heavens and the earth,”
2:1	eaz5			וְ⁠כָל צְבָאָֽ⁠ם	1	This phrase refers to everything in the heavens and on the earth that God had created, as described in chapter 1. Alternate translation: “along with everything in them.”
2:2	lmmc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that God had completed his work by the seventh day and did not work on that day. Also consider again how you translated ordinal numbers in Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2. Alternate translation: “By day seven”
2:2	zkij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְכַ֤ל אֱלֹהִים֙	1	Decide whether it is better in your language to refer to God with a title (**God**) or a pronoun (**he**) in this context. Alternate translation: “he had completed” or “God was finished with”
2:2	qp74			מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה	1	 Alternate translation: “his work he had been doing,”
2:2	lqw7			וַ⁠יִּשְׁבֹּת֙ בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִ⁠כָּל	1	God **rested** in the sense that he stopped his work and did not work on that day. It does not mean he was tired or had lost his strength. Rest is an important theme in the Bible, so you should try to be consistent in how you translate this term here and in other passages such as Exodus 23:12, 31:17 and Hebrews 4:4, 10. Part of this theme includes the Hebrew word for “Sabbath” which has the same root word as the verb for “rest” and is often translated “resting day.” Alternate translation: “so he ceased on that day from all” or “so on the seventh day he no longer did”
2:2	mtu9			מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָֽׂה	1	 Alternate translation: “the work that he had been doing.”
2:3	aq2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יְבָ֤רֶךְ אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת י֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	For some languages it is more natural to begin verse 3 without a conjunction. Other languages use a conjunction here like Hebrew does. Do what is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Then he designated the seventh day as a day to bless people” or “He honored the seventh day”
2:3	frsr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יְקַדֵּ֖שׁ אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “and made it a holy day,” or “and set it apart as a day especially devoted to him,” or “by setting it apart as a special day for people to rest and worship him,”
2:3	zlsb			כִּ֣י ב֤⁠וֹ	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “because during that day” or “He did that because during that day”
2:3	kcwq			שָׁבַת֙ מִ⁠כָּל מְלַאכְתּ֔⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2. Alternate translation: “he ceased from all the work” or “he did not do any more work”
2:3	oxs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר בָּרָ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	 Alternate translation: “of creating that he had been doing.”
2:4	m6ic			אֵ֣לֶּה	1	This phrase refers forward to Gen 2:5-24 and begins a new section. Chapter one of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. Chapter two gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “These are more details about” or “This is more about” or “What follows gives more details about”
2:4	ptfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תוֹלְד֧וֹת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֛יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בְּ⁠הִבָּֽרְאָ֑⁠ם	1	The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth. Decide the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: “the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created by God,” or “what happened when God created the heavens and the earth.”
2:4	i0br			בְּ⁠י֗וֹם	1	Consider whether or not it is clearer or more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 5. Alternate translation: “during the days when” or “During the days when”
2:4	igt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	This phrase is a combination of God’s personal name **Yahweh** with his title “God.” Both are used together when he is especially in focus. This pattern of using a personal name and a title together is also used for people in the Old Testament when they are being emphasized, for example, “Ahab king of Israel” and “Ruth the Moabitess.” Many translations have “LORD God” in place of **Yahweh God** throughout the Old Testament. This follows the Jewish custom of substituting the Hebrew title “Adonai” (which means “my Lord”) for **Yahweh** (which means “he is”) when they read the Scriptures aloud. More recently, translation teams are putting **Yahweh** back in the Bible text (especially in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament), and they include a footnote to explain the term. (Some translation teams consider using “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh.” However that is not a name from the Bible, but is formed by taking the consonants from **Yahweh** and combining them with the vowels from “Adonai.”) Alternate translation: “God whose name is Yahweh”
2:4	h1ao		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-chiasm	עֲשׂ֛וֹת & אֶ֥רֶץ וְ⁠שָׁמָֽיִם	1	This clause forms a chiasm with “the heavens and the earth … created” in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated **the heavens** and **the earth** in Gen 1:1 and 2:1. Alternate translation: “created the earth and the heavens”
2:5	yi7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠כֹ֣ל ׀ שִׂ֣יחַ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה טֶ֚רֶם יִֽהְיֶ֣ה בָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your translation to begin a new sentence here. Verses 5-6 give background information about what things were like before God created mankind (verse 7). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Now for a while, there were not yet any shrubs in the fields on the earth,” or “For a while, no wild shrubs had started growing on the earth yet,”
2:5	gyov			וְ⁠כָל עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה טֶ֣רֶם יִצְמָ֑ח	1	See how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29-30. Alternate translation: “nor had any other plants started growing yet,”
2:5	iiqn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כִּי֩ & יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙	1	The Hebrew text repeats **Yahweh God** frequently in chapter 2 (starting in verse 4) to emphasize God. For some languages, it is not natural to repeat **Yahweh God** so often in the same paragraph, and it could even give the wrong meaning that there was more than one Yahweh God. For languages like that, it may be best to use **Yahweh God** only once at the beginning of a section or paragraph, then use **Yahweh**, **God**, or “he” in the rest of the section, depending on the context. Consider what is the most accurate and natural way to refer to Yahweh God at each point in your translation. Alternate translation: “because he”
2:5	dsr2			לֹ֨א הִמְטִ֜יר & עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	See how you translated **earth** in Gen 1:1 and 2:1. Alternate translation: “had not yet caused it to rain on the earth,” or “had not yet caused rain to water the earth,”
2:5	jour			וְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אַ֔יִן	1	 Alternate translation: “and there were no human beings yet” or “and mankind did not exist yet”
2:5	mdd4			לַֽ⁠עֲבֹ֖ד אֶת הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	Working the ground includes tasks such as clearing the ground, preparing the soil, planting seeds, and watering the plants. See how you translated **ground** in Gen 1:25. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “to farm the land”
2:6	vsou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠אֵ֖ד	1	The Hebrew word for **mist** refers to water in some form, such as water vapor, springs, or streams of water. Also, some translations begin verse 6 without **But**. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “But at that time mist” or “At that time mist”
2:6	ytxq			יַֽעֲלֶ֣ה	1	This verb describes a repeated or continuous action. Alternate translation: “seeped up” or “kept coming up” or “would seep up”
2:6	t93l			מִן הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	 Alternate translation: “from the ground” or “from underground”
2:6	srec			וְ⁠הִשְׁקָ֖ה	1	 Alternate translation: “and irrigated” or “and spread over”
2:6	qd1o			אֶֽת כָּל פְּנֵֽי הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	 Alternate translation: “the whole surface of the earth.” or “the ground everywhere.”
2:7	fjjv			וַ⁠יִּיצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	The word **formed** describes what an expert craftsmen would do, and implies artistic skills and design. See how you translated **Yahweh God** in Gen 2:4-5. Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh who is God shaped”
2:7	dbat			אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	The definite article **the** is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human. For many languages it is more natural to use an indefinite article (**a**) to introduce him here, or to not use an article at all. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “the first man”
2:7	pmfi			עָפָר֙	1	The word used here in the Hebrew text is usually translated **dust** (as in Gen 13:16, 28:14), but it can also be translated “dirt” (as in Gen 26:15) or “mortar/mud/clay” (as in Leviticus 14:42). The dirt would have been damp enough to be formed or shaped. Alternate translation: “out of mud”
2:7	g3a2			מִן הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in the first half of this verse and say, “Then Yahweh who is God took some dirt/clay from the ground/earth and formed/shaped a man out of it,” Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated **ground** in Gen 1:25 and 2:5-6. You may need to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “from the earth,”
2:7	xkca			וַ⁠יִּפַּ֥ח	1	For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and he blew” or “Then he exhaled”
2:7	qzjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠אַפָּ֖י⁠ו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים	1	This refers to God’s breath. As you translate the pronouns **he** and **his** in this verse, make sure it is clear in your language who is being referred to.
2:7	vf52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לְ⁠נֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּֽה	1	Consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the man throughout verse 7. Alternate translation: “so that he became a living person.” or “and then the man became alive” or “and he came to life.” or “so that he started to live.”
2:8	z5wl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּטַּ֞ע יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “Now Yahweh God had previously/already planted” or “Before that, Yahweh God had planted”. This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three (Gen 1:11-12), three days before he created man (Gen 1:26-27; 2:7). Following this view, verses 8-14 give background information for what happens in verses 15-24. (2) “Then Yahweh God planted”. According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six after he created man.
2:8	npa8			גַּן	1	The man lived in this garden, and there were animals and many trees and other plants in it too, so it was fairly large. Make sure your translation of this term does not refer to something that is too small. Alternate translation: “a large park”
2:8	msch			בְ⁠עֵ֖דֶן מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	In this context, the phrase **in the east** could refer to: (1) the eastern part of the region of Eden; or (2) a region east of where Moses lived when he wrote this. It is best, if possible, to keep your translation of this phrase general here (like the Hebrew text). Alternate translation: “in the region called Eden, which was to the east,” or “in the eastern part of the land of Eden,”
2:8	zpxl			וַ⁠יָּ֣שֶׂם שָׁ֔ם אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “and in that garden he put the man” or “That is where he put the man”
2:8	uvlv			אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָצָֽר	1	See how you translated **formed** in verse 7. Alternate translation: “whom he had shaped” or “whom he had created”
2:9	wihv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּצְמַ֞ח יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ מִן־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה כָּל־עֵ֛ץ נֶחְמָ֥ד	1	See how you translated **Yahweh God** in verse 5, and how you translated **every tree** in Gen 1:29. Alternate translation: “There he had caused to grow from the ground every type of tree that is beautiful” or “He had made all kinds of trees to grow from the ground that are pleasant”
2:9	zqug			לְ⁠מַרְאֶ֖ה	1	 Alternate translation: “to the eyes” or “in appearance”
2:9	kslw			וְ⁠ט֣וֹב	1	 Alternate translation: “and that have fruit that is good” or “and whose fruit is good”
2:9	rc1t			לְ⁠מַאֲכָ֑ל	1	 Alternate translation: “for eating,”
2:9	urhf			וְ⁠עֵ֤ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּים֙ בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠גָּ֔ן	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “including the tree whose fruit gives people eternal life, which was in the middle of the garden,”
2:9	vdwn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וְ⁠עֵ֕ץ הַ⁠דַּ֖עַת ט֥וֹב וָ⁠רָֽע	1	The word **good** refers here to all that is morally right and pleasing to God, and **evil** refers to what is morally wrong and against his will. Keep that in mind as you translate these terms. Alternate translation: “as well as the tree whose fruit enables people to discern what is right and what is wrong.”
2:10	af8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠נָהָרּ֙ יֹצֵ֣א	1	Verse 10 gives more background information that began in verse 8. Many translations omit the conjunction **And** or “Now” here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Now a river was flowing” or “A river was flowing”
2:10	pp02			מֵ⁠עֵ֔דֶן	1	The garden was inside the land of Eden, so as the river flowed through Eden, it watered the garden. Alternate translation: “from the land of Eden”
2:10	rcms			לְ⁠הַשְׁק֖וֹת	1	See how you translated “watered” in verse 6. Alternate translation: “to irrigate” or “to provide water for” or “that watered”
2:10	wxka			אֶת הַ⁠גָּ֑ן	1	See how you translated this phrase in verse 8. Alternate translation: “the park,”
2:10	gpkv			וּ⁠מִ⁠שָּׁם֙	1	For some languages it is better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and from the garden” or “From Eden”
2:10	h8ke			יִפָּרֵ֔ד וְ⁠הָיָ֖ה לְ⁠אַרְבָּעָ֥ה רָאשִֽׁים	1	Verse 10 is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean: (1) “the/that river divided into four smaller waters/rivers.” This interpretation means that the river in Eden was the source river that watered the garden and then divided downstream into the four smaller rivers. (2) “there were four smaller source rivers that joined together and formed the larger river.” This interpretation means that the four rivers were source headwaters that flowed downstream and joined to form the larger river in Eden. If possible, leave your translation ambiguous here (like the Hebrew text does), so that either interpretation is possible.
2:11	ty1t			שֵׁ֥ם הָֽ⁠אֶחָ֖ד	1	Most translations use past tense in verse 10, but then use present tense throughout verses 11-14. It may be best to use past tense throughout verses 10-14, especially since the rivers and places that are named in these verses no longer existed when Genesis was written, because the Flood completely changed the entire surface of the earth; after the Flood, the names of some of those rivers and places were given to new rivers and places. Alternate translation: “The name of the first river is” or “The first river is named” or “The first river is”
2:11	fhgs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	פִּישׁ֑וֹן	1	Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use the article (**the**) with the name of a river.
2:11	k73q			ה֣וּא הַ⁠סֹּבֵ֗ב	1	The word **winds** or “meanders” means that the river changed direction from time to time.

In many translations it is transliterated, that is, spelled the way the Hebrew word is pronounced. It may refer to: (1) a fragrant/sweet-smelling tree resin that was used to make perfume; or (2) a type of stone or crystal, or possibly pearl. Alternate translation: “A kind of sweet-smelling resin called bdellium” or “A kind of fragrant perfume”
2:12	ul5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠אֶ֥בֶן הַ⁠שֹּֽׁהַם	1	It is not certain what kind of stone this was, but most Bible scholars think it was onyx, which is a kind of quartz that is often black, but also occurs in many other colors, and can have stripes or bands of white (or other colors) running through it.

2:14	go4b			ה֥וּא הַֽ⁠הֹלֵ֖ךְ קִדְמַ֣ת	1	The word **east** refers to where the river was located, not the direction it was flowing. Alternate translation: “It flows in an area east of” or “which flows in an area east of” or “which was located east of”
2:14	h2lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אַשּׁ֑וּר	1	This Hebrew name is pronounced “ash-shur” and is spelled “Asshur,” “Ashur,” or “Assyria” in English, depending on the context. This was a region of land, because at that time there were no cities. Most translations have “Assyria” here. Consider again how you translated “the land of” in verses 11 and 13. Alternate translation: “the land of Asshur”
2:14	wu7c			וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּהָ֥ר הָֽ⁠רְבִיעִ֖י	1	See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11, 13-14.

This information is repeated here to continue the story from verse 8. Alternate translation: “Now Yahweh God had already put the man”
2:15	rosi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְ⁠גַן עֵ֔דֶן	1	Notice that **Garden** is capitalized when it is part of a name. Alternate translation: “in the garden in the land called Eden”

To make that clear, you could say (starting with the beginning of God’s words in verse 16), “Out of all the trees in the garden, there is only one tree that you must/may not eat from: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat fruit from that tree, on that same day you will certainly/definitely die.” Alternate translation: “except you may not eat any fruit from the tree” or “except for one: you may not eat the fruit that grows on the tree”

Translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is background information that has already happened. Also see how you translated **formed** in verses 7-8 and “dust from the ground” in verse 7. Alternate translation: “Now before that, Yahweh God had shaped from the dust on the ground” or “Now previously, he had used dust from the ground to form”

2:19	p3x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶל הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	Every translation team needs to decide when to use Adam’s name for the first time in the book of Genesis. The Hebrew word “adam” means **man** and is also Adam’s name; the choice that is not followed here in your translation could be put in a footnote. Some translations first use Adam’s name here in verse 19, when he is naming the animals. Many other translations start using his name at the end of verse 20. Still other translations wait until 3:20 when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in 3:9, 17, or 21. Alternate translation: “to Adam”
2:19	apte			לִ⁠רְא֖וֹת	1	 Alternate translation: “to watch” or “to find out”
2:19	rgyf			מַה יִּקְרָא ל֑⁠וֹ	1	These names were labels for what kind of animals they were, such as “dog” or “horse”, not personal names like “David” or “Mary”. Alternate translation: “what he would name each one,” or “what names he would give to them,”

Consider what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh God caused the man to go into a deep sleep.” or “Then Yahweh God caused the man to sleep very deeply”
2:21	ti50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּישָׁ֑ן	1	Consider whether it is best in your language to use a pronoun or a noun here to refer to the man. Alternate translation: “Then while the man was sleeping”

2:22	wmbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּבֶן֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֧ים	1	For many languages it is more natural here to use a pronoun to refer to Yahweh God. Do what is best in your language. After you finish translating a chapter or section, it is a good practice to read that section aloud and listen for what is the best way to refer to God and others at each place in the text. Alternate translation: “Next he” or “After that, he”
2:22	m5wn			וַ⁠יִּבֶן֩ & אֶֽת הַ⁠צֵּלָ֛ע אֲשֶׁר לָקַ֥ח מִן הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לְ⁠אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	See how you translated **rib** in verse 21 and see the note about that there. Alternate translation: “used the rib which he taken from the man to construct a woman from it,”

2:23	pbw7			לְ⁠זֹאת֙ יִקָּרֵ֣א אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	There is a play-on-words here because the Hebrew word for woman (“ishsha”) is similar to the Hebrew word for man (“ish”). You could put that information in a footnote.

2:24	lhdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠בָשָׂ֥ר אֶחָֽד	1	The phrase **one flesh** is an idiom that emphasizes the close physical and spiritual unity between a husband and wife.

3:1	xal9			אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the animals that God had made, not the fields.

3:5	npzf			וִ⁠הְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽ⁠אלֹהִ֔ים יֹדְעֵ֖י ט֥וֹב וָ⁠רָֽע	1	The Hebrew word “Elohim” is ambiguous in this context. It could mean: (1) **God**, which is what it means everywhere else in the first 30 chapters of Genesis; or (2) “gods” or “divine beings” or (3) “angels”. See how you translated **good and evil** in Gen 2:9, 17. Alternate translation: “and as a result you will be like God because you will know what is good and what is evil” or “so that you will know what is good and what is evil just like God does.”

Also, some languages have dual pronouns that can be used in verses 7-8 for **they** and **themselves**. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “So they joined together”
3:7	e5t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עֲלֵ֣ה תְאֵנָ֔ה	1	Historical facts should not be changed in a translation, including the historical fact that Adam and Eve used fig tree leaves to make aprons. If fig trees are not known in your language area, you could say “large leaves from a tree called a fig tree”. Alternate translation: “some large leaves from a fig tree”
3:7	h1a6			וַ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֥וּ לָ⁠הֶ֖ם חֲגֹרֹֽת	1	These aprons/skirts probably covered them from the waist down to somewhere around the knees. Alternate translation: “and used them as aprons to cover their bodies.” or “and wore them around their waists to cover their bodies.” or “and used them to make clothes for themselves.”
3:8	ibyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֞וּ	1	For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the noun phrase **the man and his wife** here and then use a pronoun (**they**) later in this sentence. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Then the man and his wife heard”
3:8	kd3q			אֶת ק֨וֹל יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים מִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ	1	This phrase can refer to the sound of God’s footsteps or to the sound of his voice. Either meaning fits the context well and is followed by many translations.
3:8	g02y			בַּ⁠גָּ֖ן	1	 Alternate translation: “around in the garden” or “through the garden”
3:8	dipk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠ר֣וּחַ הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	This idiom refers to the late afternoon or early evening when there is a breeze blowing and it is cooler. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase at the beginning of the sentence. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “late in the afternoon in the breezy time of the day,” or “late that day when there was a cool breeze blowing,”
3:8	x1fb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְחַבֵּ֨א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֜ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	If you use **the man and his wife** earlier in this verse in your translation, consider whether or not a pronoun should be used here. Alternate translation: “so they hid themselves” or “so they tried to hide themselves”
3:8	q6cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִ⁠פְּנֵי֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh at this point in the paragraph in your language. Alternate translation: “from Yahweh God” or “from his sight”
3:8	k6j3			בְּ⁠ת֖וֹךְ עֵ֥ץ הַ⁠גָּֽן	1	Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in verse 8, for some languages it may be more natural to be general here and say “there”. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “in the midst of the trees in the garden.” or “behind some trees there.”
3:9	e4nw			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֛א יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	See how you translated this name for God in verses 1 and 8. Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh God called out”
3:9	ek33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אֶל הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר ל֖⁠וֹ	1	See the note at Gen 2:19 about when to start using Adam’s name. Also consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. Alternate translation: “to the man and asked him,” or “to Adam,”
3:9	a04v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַיֶּֽ⁠כָּה	1	Notice that the word **you** is singular here because God is only addressing the man.
3:10	e1lo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	 Alternate translation: “He answered him,”
3:10	mb7t			אֶת קֹלְ⁠ךָ֥ שָׁמַ֖עְתִּי	1	See how you translated **sound** in verse 8. Alternate translation: “I heard your voice” or “I heard the sound of your voice as you walked”
3:10	tr9j			בַּ⁠גָּ֑ן	1	 Alternate translation: “through the garden,”
3:10	aoxc			וָ⁠אִירָ֛א כִּֽי עֵירֹ֥ם אָנֹ֖כִי וָ⁠אֵחָבֵֽא	1	 Alternate translation: “but I was naked, so I felt afraid and I hid from you.” or “but I was naked and afraid that you would see me, so I hid.”
3:11	hsb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	Make sure your translation of **he** refers to Yahweh here, not the man. Alternate translation: “So Yahweh God asked him,”
3:11	uf06		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מִ֚י הִגִּ֣יד לְ⁠ךָ֔ כִּ֥י עֵירֹ֖ם אָ֑תָּה	1	The pronoun **you** is still singular here. Alternate translation: “What made you realize that you were naked?” or “How did you find out that you were naked?”
3:11	gi9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֧ר צִוִּיתִ֛י⁠ךָ לְ⁠בִלְתִּ֥י אֲכָל מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ	1	For some languages it is more natural to use a direct quote here for Yahweh’s words. Do what is best in your language.
3:12	hp6r			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	 Alternate translation: “But the man replied to him,” or “The man answered him,”
3:12	et6h			הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נָתַ֣תָּה עִמָּדִ֔⁠י הִ֛וא	1	The pronoun **she** is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of **The woman** at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame of the woman. Consider what is the best way to communicate that emphasis in your language. Alternate translation: “The woman whom you put here to live with me, she is the one who” or “It was the woman you gave to me who”
3:12	au82			נָֽתְנָה לִּ֥⁠י מִן הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	See how you translated **fruit** in verses 1-6. Alternate translation: “gave me some fruit from that tree,” or “gave me some of the fruit,”
3:12	z2ws			וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “That is why I ate it”
3:13	lvw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים לָ⁠אִשָּׁ֖ה	1	Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. Alternate translation: “So Yahweh God asked the woman,”
3:13	vvhk			מַה זֹּ֣את עָשִׂ֑ית	1	God already knew the answer to this question, but he is giving the woman a chance to confess and explain what she did. God’s question probably also implies that he is displeased with what has happened. Alternate translation: “What have you done?” or “Tell me what you have done.”
3:13	rhhc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר֙ הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	 Alternate translation: “But the woman said to him,” or “The woman said” or “She replied,”
3:13	n1zl			הַ⁠נָּחָ֥שׁ	1	This phrase is emphasized in the Hebrew text. Alternate translation: “It was the snake that”
3:13	w0b8			הִשִּׁיאַ֖⁠נִי	1	 Alternate translation: “lied to me,”
3:13	bews			וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “so I ate some of that fruit.” or “That is why I ate it”
3:14	ie75			כִּ֣י עָשִׂ֣יתָ זֹּאת֒	1	 Alternate translation: “Since you did that,” or “Since you tricked the woman,”
3:14	dfy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אָר֤וּר אַתָּה֙	1	In this context, **cursed** involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants, causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic. Alternate translation: “you are cursed by me” or “I will cause you to suffer” or “I will punish you”
3:14	qu53			מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה	1	When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Gen 3:14, God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals. See how you translated **livestock** in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20. Alternate translation: “more harshly than all the tame animals”
3:14	d3v1			וּ⁠מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל חַיַּ֣ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה	1	See how you translated **every living thing of the field** in verse 1. Alternate translation: “and more harshly than all the creatures of the fields” or “and more harshly than all the wild animals.”
3:14	obw6			עַל גְּחֹנְ⁠ךָ֣ תֵלֵ֔ךְ	1	 Alternate translation: “As a result, you will move on the ground on your stomach,”
3:14	aocs			וְ⁠עָפָ֥ר תֹּאכַ֖ל	1	Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an idiom that refers to the fact that as he slithers along, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated **dust** in Gen 2:7. Alternate translation: “and you will eat dirt with your food”
3:14	g32q			כָּל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	 Alternate translation: “your entire life.”
3:15	ivt7			וְ⁠אֵיבָ֣ה אָשִׁ֗ית בֵּֽינְ⁠ךָ֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה וּ⁠בֵ֥ין זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין זַרְעָ֑⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “I will also cause you and the woman to be enemies with each other, and your offspring and her offspring to also be enemies.”
3:15	yfon			ה֚וּא	1	The pronoun **He** is ambiguous here. It could refer to: (1) the woman’s descendant (Jesus) who would one day come to earth as the Messiah/Christ; or (2) the woman’s descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake’s descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Messiah/Christ (“the Anointed One” or “the Promised Savior King”) who would come to earth and destroy Satan’s power (Hebrews 2:14). You could include that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “In fact, her offspring” or “In fact, one of her descendants”
3:15	e3wq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יְשׁוּפְ⁠ךָ֣ רֹ֔אשׁ וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תְּשׁוּפֶ֥⁠נּוּ עָקֵֽב	1	This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, “In fact, you will strike/bite/bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will strike/crush your head.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “will crush your head, and you will bruise his heel.”
3:16	chez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֶֽל הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֣ה אָמַ֗ר	1	In the Hebrew text, “to the woman” comes first in this sentence, to emphasize her. Do what is natural in your language. Also consider what is the best way to refer to God here in your language. Alternate translation: “Then he said to the woman,” or “Then Yahweh God turned to the woman and said to her,”
3:16	vgi1			הַרְבָּ֤ה אַרְבֶּה֙ עִצְּבוֹנֵ֣⁠ךְ	1	 Alternate translation: “I will cause you to have much pain” or “I will cause it to be very painful”
3:16	icn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠עֶ֖צֶב תֵּֽלְדִ֣י בָנִ֑ים	1	This clause is the second part of a parallelism, which emphasizes the pain and suffering that women will experience when they bear children. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Alternate translation: “yes you will suffer much pain when you give birth.” or “yes bearing children will be very painful for you.”
3:16	jbk6			וְ⁠אֶל אִישֵׁ⁠ךְ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָתֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here, because the conjunctions and the idiom **your desire will be for your husband** are all ambiguous in this context. The text could mean: (1) “Yet/But you will still desire/long to be with your husband, and he …”, which is similar to what **desire** means in Song of Songs 7:10; or (2) “Besides that, you will desire/want to control your husband, but he …”, which is similar to what **desire** means in Gen 4:7. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.
3:16	friw			וְ⁠ה֖וּא יִמְשָׁל בָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	See how you translated **rule over** in Gen 1:18. It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin. Alternate translation: “and he will control you.” or “and he will lord it over you.”
3:17	sq0d			וּ⁠לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אָמַ֗ר	1	In the Hebrew text, the phrase **to the man** is emphasized. See how you translated a similar case (“to the woman”) in verse 16. For a note about when to start using Adam’s name in your translation, see Gen 2:19. Alternate translation: “Next God said to the man,” or “Next Yahweh God turned to Adam and said to him,”
3:17	dyjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּֽי־שָׁמַעְתָּ֮ לְ⁠ק֣וֹל אִשְׁתֶּ⁠ךָ֒	1	This phrase means that Adam heard what his wife said to him and then did what she said. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: “Since you disobeyed me and did what your wife said” or “Since you did what your wife told you to do”
3:17	x2ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֤ר צִוִּיתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also see how you translated this command in verse 3. Alternate translation: “that I commanded you to not eat any fruit from.”
3:17	ggfr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲרוּרָ֤ה הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽ⁠עֲבוּרֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to break up this long sentence and say, “You did what your wife said and ate fruit from the tree that I commanded you not to eat any fruit from. Because of what you did, I have cursed the ground.” Also see how you translated **cursed** in verse 14. Alternate translation: “the ground is cursed by me because of what you did.” or “I have cursed the ground because you sinned.”
3:17	wdns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	בְּ⁠עִצָּבוֹן֙ תֹּֽאכֲלֶ֔⁠נָּה	1	 Alternate translation: “As a result, only by painful toil will you eat any food from it” or “As a result, you will have to work very hard and suffer to get enough food to eat”
3:17	o4tu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	For some languages it is better to put this phrase before the previous clause and say, “As a result, for as long as you live, you will have to work very hard and suffer to grow/get enough food to eat.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “every day of your life.” or “for your entire life.”
3:18	gzbg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠ק֥וֹץ וְ⁠דַרְדַּ֖ר תַּצְמִ֣יחַֽ	1	The thorn and thistle plants represent all types of weeds, which are useless and possibly harmful plants. Alternate translation: “In fact, the ground will produce thorn plants and thistle plants and other weeds” or “In fact, thorn bushes and thistle plants and other weeds will grow from the ground”
3:18	z3ub			לָ֑⁠ךְ וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ אֶת עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶֽה	1	The Hebrew text here could mean: (1) “and make it difficult for you to grow enough crops in the/your fields for food.” or “so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to grow/produce enough crops/food to eat.” or (2) “so that your crops will not grow well and you will have to eat wild plants that grow in the open fields to survive.” That difference of interpretation comes from the fact that the Hebrew word **fields** can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow.
3:19	ewn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠זֵעַ֤ת אַפֶּ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תֹּ֣אכַל לֶ֔חֶם	1	The phrase “by the sweat of your nose/brow” is an idiom that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. Also, bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for **bread** is used here as an idiom that refers to all food, not just bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like “food,” especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area. Alternate translation: “Only by the sweat of your face will you be able to have enough food to eat,” or “You will have to work hard and sweat a lot in order to have enough food to eat,”
3:19	n8ba			עַ֤ד שֽׁוּבְ⁠ךָ֙ אֶל הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	 Alternate translation: “until you die and again become dust”
3:19	ek0a			כִּ֥י מִמֶּ֖⁠נָּה לֻקָּ֑חְתָּ	1	 Alternate translation: “which you were made from by me.” or “which I took you from.” or “which I made you out of.”
3:19	d4o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	This sentence rephrases and emphasizes what God just said. Alternate translation: “Indeed,”
3:19	nwc3			עָפָ֣ר אַ֔תָּה	1	 Alternate translation: “your bodies were made by me from dust” or “I made you out of dust”
3:19	qlcr			וְ⁠אֶל עָפָ֖ר תָּשֽׁוּב	1	 Alternate translation: “so dust is what you will become again after you die.”
3:20	wmrp			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֛ם שֵׁ֥ם אִשְׁתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Some translations use Adam’s name here because he is naming Eve. See what you did in verse 17. Alternate translation: “Then Adam called his wife” or “Then the man gave his wife the name”
3:20	czch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	חַוָּ֑ה	1	If you include the meaning of Eve’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning (**living**), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis.
3:20	alel			כִּ֛י	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He did that because”
3:20	q3ny			הִ֥וא הָֽיְתָ֖ה אֵ֥ם	1	 Alternate translation: “she would be the ancestor of”
3:20	kvu6			כָּל חָֽי	1	 Alternate translation: “all the people who would ever live.”
3:21	idfq			וַ⁠יַּעַשׂ֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים & כָּתְנ֥וֹת ע֖וֹר	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh God made some garments out of animal skins” or “Then Yahweh God used some animal hides to make some garments”
3:21	yd2w			לְ⁠אָדָ֧ם וּ⁠לְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֛⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “for Adam and his wife Eve,” or “for the man and his wife,”
3:21	nedp			וַ⁠יַּלְבִּשֵֽׁ⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “and he dressed them.” or “and he put the garments on them.”
3:22	zmrj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh God in your language at this point in the paragraph. Also, see how you translated a similar quote margin in Gen 1:26, where **said** has the same meaning. Alternate translation: “Then he said” or “Then he said to himself,”
3:22	tgmz			הֵ֤ן	1	This word expresses emotion and calls attention to what God says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29. Alternate translation: “Listen,”
3:22	m45e			הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	Throughout verses 22-24 **the man** represents mankind, which included both the man and the woman at this point. Make sure your translation communicates that clearly in those verses and does not just refer to Adam. Alternate translation: “the man and his wife” or “mankind” or “human beings”
3:22	jtzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	הָיָה֙ כְּ⁠אַחַ֣ד מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	The pronoun **us** is inclusive because God is talking to himself. Alternate translation: “have become like us”
3:22	u2uz			לָ⁠דַ֖עַת ט֣וֹב וָ⁠רָ֑ע	1	See how you translated this phrase in verse 5 and a similar phrase in Gen 2:9.
3:22	z722			וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה פֶּן יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לָקַח֙ גַּ֚ם	1	See how you translated “took/picked … fruit” in verse 6. Alternate translation: “So now, they must not be allowed by us to also pick” or “So we must not allow them to also pick” or “So now we must do something so that they can not also pick”
3:22	jc4x			מֵ⁠עֵ֣ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּ֔ים וְ⁠אָכַ֖ל	1	See how you translated **the tree of life** in Gen 2:9. Alternate translation: “fruit from the tree of eternal life and eat some of it,”
3:22	ekrd			וָ⁠חַ֥י לְ⁠עֹלָֽם	1	 Alternate translation: “and so live forever!” or “which would make them live forever!”
3:23	x97q			וַֽ⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֛⁠הוּ יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Notice that in verses 22-24, “the man”, **him**, and **he** refer to mankind, that is, the man and the woman. Make sure it is clear in your translation here that both of them were sent out of the garden, not just the man. Consider again how you translated **Yahweh God** in Genesis 2 and 3, and see the note about this at Gen 2:4. Some languages have dual pronouns that are used for “they” and “them” in verses 22-24. Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh God banished the man and his wife” or “So then Yahweh God forced them to leave”
3:23	kl96			מִ⁠גַּן עֵ֑דֶן	1	See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:15. Alternate translation: “the garden in the land of Eden”
3:23	hhh0			לַֽ⁠עֲבֹד֙ אֶת הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	See how you translated **work the ground** in Gen 2:5 and “work it” in 2:15. Alternate translation: “to farm the land”
3:23	d3re			אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֻקַּ֖ח מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	It does not refer to the exact ground that he was made from. See how you translated **taken from** in verse 19. Alternate translation: “which they had been taken from by him” or “which he had taken them from.”
3:24	j8r9			וַ⁠יְגָ֖רֶשׁ אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	 Alternate translation: “Then after God drove the man and his wife out of the garden,” or “After God banished them from the garden,”
3:24	v4dm			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּן֩	1	 Alternate translation: “then he stationed”
3:24	zcdx			מִ⁠קֶּ֨דֶם לְ⁠גַן עֵ֜דֶן	1	It is implied that the entrance to the garden is where the cherubim were placed to keep everyone from ever entering the garden again. Consider again how you translated “garden” in Gen 2:8-10, 15-16; 3:1-3, 8, 10, 23-24. Alternate translation: “on the east side of the garden at its entrance” or “at the entrance to the garden, which was on its east side”
3:24	n3sj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת הַ⁠כְּרֻבִ֗ים	1	Most translations transliterate or borrow this term from Hebrew throughout the Bible. Cherubim are a special category of very powerful angels. Each one has four faces: a human face, a lion’s face, a bull’s face and an eagle’s face (Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14). Each of them also has multiple wings. You could include some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “some powerful beings called cherubim angels”
3:24	gndv			וְ⁠אֵ֨ת לַ֤הַט הַ⁠חֶ֨רֶב֙	1	A sword is a weapon that has a very long, sharp (often two-sided) blade that is longer than a knife, machete, or dagger and is attached to a hilt or handle. This sword may have had flames coming from it, or this may have been fire in the shape of a sword. Alternate translation: “and a fiery sword” or “and a sword made of flames”
3:24	i7zi			הַ⁠מִּתְהַפֶּ֔כֶת	1	It seems that the sword was swinging by itself since there is no mention of anyone holding it. Alternate translation: “that was turning around in all directions” or “that was flashing back and forth”
3:24	orao			לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֕ר אֶת דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	 Alternate translation: “to keep everyone away from the way that leads to” or “so that no one could go near”
3:24	ar1o			עֵ֥ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּֽים	1	See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:9 and 3:22. Alternate translation: “the tree of eternal life.” or “the tree whose fruit gives people eternal life.”
4:1	cibb			וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	For a note about when to begin referring to the man as Adam, see Gen 2:19. Alternate translation: “Then the man Adam”
4:1	k9i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יָדַ֖ע אֶת חַוָּ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	This phrase is a Hebrew idiom that means Adam had marital/sexual relations with Eve. Many languages have a similar idiom. Make sure you translate this in a way that is polite and will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud. Alternate translation: “slept with his wife Eve,” or “was intimate with his wife Eve,”
4:1	um2r			וַ⁠תַּ֨הַר֙ וַ⁠תֵּ֣לֶד	1	Translate this clause in a way that will not embarrass people, especially when read aloud. Alternate translation: “so that she became pregnant and later gave birth to”
4:1	a1ox			אֶת קַ֔יִן	1	You could include the meaning of Cain’s name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 3:20.

It could mean: (1) “I killed a man for wounding me; he was a young man who bruised/injured me!” or “I killed a young man for wounding/injuring me! In fact, I killed that man just because he bruised/injured me!” or (2) “I killed a man for wounding me, and also a young man for bruising/injuring me.” or “A man wounded me, so I killed him.

Also, each translation team needs to decide how they will handle numbers in the Hebrew text so that readers will not confuse those numbers with verse numbers. For example, it may be best to use words for single and double-digit numbers in the text. Be consistent with how you spelled the name **Lamech** in verses 18-19, 23-24.

Many teams use numerals, for example, **130** here in verse 3, especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, “one hundred thirty” here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation. Alternate translation: “When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son” or “When Adam was 130 years old, he fathered a son”

5:29	d1z6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	What Lamech says next is the reason that he named his son Noah. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “He named him that because he had said about him,”
5:29	ivc5			זֶ֞֠ה יְנַחֲמֵ֤⁠נוּ	1	 Alternate translation: “This son will relieve us” or “This son will give us relief”
5:29	gzo5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	מִֽ⁠מַּעֲשֵׂ֨⁠נוּ֙ וּ⁠מֵ⁠עִצְּב֣וֹן יָדֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize how difficult the work was. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: “from the difficult labor and work we have to do with our hands” or “from the agonizing work that we have to do”
5:29	omyc			מִן הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵֽרְרָ֖⁠הּ יְהוָֽה	1	 Alternate translation: “as we farm the ground that Yahweh has cursed.”
5:30	d607			וַֽ⁠יְחִי לֶ֗מֶךְ אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣⁠וֹ אֶת נֹ֔חַ	1	Consider again how you translated verses in this chapter that are similar in structure to this verse; see verses 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 26, 30, and part of verses 4 and 22. Alternate translation: “After he fathered Noah, he lived” or “After Noah was born, Lamech lived”

Also make sure that the name **Lamech** is spelled consistently in your translation of verses 25-26, 28-31, and also in 4:18-19, 23-24 for a different person who has the same name. Alternate translation: “So he lived a total of 777 years,” or “All together he lived 777 years,”
5:31	ojma			וַ⁠יָּמֹֽת	1	 Alternate translation: “before he died.”
5:32	uzva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַֽ⁠יְהִי נֹ֕חַ בֶּן חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה	1	Noah’s sons were not triplets, but were born in different years after Noah was 500 years old. The way you translate this verse should allow for that meaning.
5:32	yohb			וַ⁠יּ֣וֹלֶד נֹ֔חַ	1	Consider again how you translated **fathered** in this chapter; see verses 4, 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 15-16, 18-19, 25-26, 28, 30, 32. Alternate translation: “he fathered”

6:1	pmgg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	The events in Gen 6:1-2 started happening long before the events in 5:32, so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like “Then”, which would have the wrong meaning here. Many translations omit the conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. Also, the phrase **it happened** introduces and emphasizes important background information which the following narrative builds on. It also creates suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Some translations leave this phrase out, but doing that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language.
6:1	as12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	כִּֽי	1	 Alternate translation: “that as”
6:1	mezb			הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	See how you translated this term in Gen 5:1-2. Alternate translation: “human beings”

6:2	vn76			וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ	1	Verses 1 and 2 are one long sentence in the Hebrew text. For many languages it is necessary to divide it into two or more shorter sentences. For example, depending on how you began verse 1, you could begin verse 2 with a new sentence. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Then when those girls grew up,” or “When those daughters grew up,”
6:2	w4mk			בְנֵי הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who **the sons of God** and **the daughters of mankind** refer to: (1) nonhuman, god-like (supernatural) beings, such as demons or angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7) who took human form and married the daughters of human beings (which may be what is referred to in 1 Peter 3:19–20; 2 Peter 2:4, and Jude 6); or (2) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line); or (3) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6) who married the daughters of common, poor people. Alternate translation: “some angels” or “some supernatural beings”
6:2	znk3			וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ & אֶת בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם כִּ֥י טֹבֹ֖ת הֵ֑נָּה	1	 Alternate translation: “saw that the daughters of human beings were beautiful,” or “saw that those young women were beautiful,” or “saw that they were very beautiful,”
6:2	qnty			וַ⁠יִּקְח֤וּ לָ⁠הֶם֙ נָשִׁ֔ים מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר בָּחָֽרוּ	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated “took/married” in Gen 4:19. Alternate translation: “so they married any of them that they wanted to.” or “So they chose all of them that they wanted and married them.”
6:3	fdyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language’s grammar requires it, so that your translation is easier to read and understand. Alternate translation: “So Yahweh said to himself,”
6:3	n5w7			רוּחִ֤⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) **My Spirit** or “I”, which is a way of God referring to himself (Gen 1:2 is similar); or (2) “My spirit”, which could refer to God’s breath that gives life (as in Gen 2:7). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.
6:3	lxhr			לֹֽא־יָד֨וֹן & בָֽ⁠אָדָם֙ לְ⁠עֹלָ֔ם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “will not contend with human beings forever,” or “will not put up with human beings forever,” or (2) “will not remain/live with/in human beings forever,” The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.
6:3	nsna		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠שַׁ⁠גַּ֖ם ה֣וּא בָשָׂ֑ר	1	The word **flesh** is used here as an idiom that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful/corrupt”. The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood. Alternate translation: “because they are very sinful” or “because they are only sinful mortals.”
6:3	u5p6			וְ⁠הָי֣וּ יָמָ֔י⁠ו מֵאָ֥ה וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָֽה	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “So they will have 120 years to repent.” or “I will give them 120 years to repent.” or (2) “From now on, they/people will have/live no longer than 120 years.” The first interpretation seems to best fit the context here of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.
6:4	ynoy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נְּפִלִ֞ים	1	Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word **Nephilim** here, treating it as a name. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other time in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32-33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Gen 6:4. Alternate translation: “Giants called the Nephilim” or “Giants”
6:4	mfas			הָי֣וּ בָ⁠אָרֶץ֮	1	 Alternate translation: “were living on the earth”
6:4	x5nq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בַּ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠הֵם֒ וְ⁠גַ֣ם אַֽחֲרֵי	1	It may be more natural to put this time phrase first in verse 4 and say, “During that time there were Nephilim/giants living on the earth, when …” Do what is best in your language.
6:4	brcd			כֵ֗ן אֲשֶׁ֨ר	1	Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. Alternate translation: “That was when”
6:4	dopz			בְּנֵ֤י הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	Be consistent here with how you translated this phrase in verse 2, and see the important note about that there. Alternate translation: “angels” or “supernatural beings”
6:4	pirs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יָבֹ֜אוּ & אֶל	1	Translate this idiom in a way that is polite and will not shame or embarrass people when this verse is read aloud in public.

6:4	xhsv			אַנְשֵׁ֥י הַ⁠שֵּֽׁם	1	For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “They were the mighty men of renown who were from long ago.” or “They were the famous mighty men who lived a long time ago.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “who were famous men.”
6:5	utlu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא יְהוָ֔ה	1	The verb **saw** is used here as an idiom. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Yahweh knew” or “Yahweh was aware”
6:5	ommt			כִּ֥י רַבָּ֛ה רָעַ֥ת הָ⁠אָדָ֖ם בָּ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	 Alternate translation: “how evil mankind had become on the earth,” or “that the people on the earth had become very wicked”
6:5	wy3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠כָל יֵ֨צֶר֙ מַחְשְׁבֹ֣ת לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	In Hebrew culture the heart is considered the center of thoughts and desires.

6:5	wfz7			כָּל הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	 Alternate translation: “constantly.”
6:6	kp4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּנָּ֣חֶם יְהוָ֔ה	1	 Alternate translation: “As a result, Yahweh regretted” or “Yahweh regretted”

6:6	lbxh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּתְעַצֵּ֖ב אֶל לִבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Alternate translation: “and his heart was filled with pain” or “and he was very sad”
6:7	mt6s			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. Also make sure that the way you begin verse 7 fits well with the way you begin verse 6. Alternate translation: “Then he said to himself,”
6:7	wbhw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶמְחֶ֨ה	1	Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Alternate translation: “I will wash away” or “I will blot out” or “I will completely wipe”
6:7	ymf2			אֶת הָ⁠אָדָ֤ם אֲשֶׁר בָּרָ֨אתִי֙ מֵ⁠עַל֙ פְּנֵ֣י הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	 Alternate translation: “all the human beings whom I created, from the surface of the earth,”

6:7	acg2			כִּ֥י עֲשִׂיתִֽ⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “that I ever created them.”
6:8	k0ja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נֹ֕חַ מָ֥צָא חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	The idiom “find favor” means to please someone. And the idiom **in the eyes of** refers to someone’s opinion about something or someone. Consider whether your language has similar idioms that work well here or whether it is better to translate this sentence without an idiom. Alternate translation: “But Noah pleased God.” or “However, Yahweh was pleased with Noah.”
6:9	u5k8			אֵ֚לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת נֹ֔חַ	1	Some of Noah’s history has already been given in Gen 5:29, 32, and 6:8. What follows tells more about him. Alternate translation: “This is more of the record of Noah and his family:” or “What follows tells more about Noah and his family:”

6:9	w0cg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תָּמִ֥ים הָיָ֖ה בְּ⁠דֹֽרֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “He alone was blameless/faultless in God’s eyes among his contemporaries.” or “Out of all the people living at that time, Noah/he was the only one whom God considered blameless.” or (2) “He had a blameless/spotless reputation among his contemporaries.” or “His contemporaries considered him to be a man of integrity.” The phrase **without blemish** is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as an idiom that means Noah was “blameless/faultless” in an ethical or moral sense, or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also, the word **generation** refers here to people who lived during the same time period.
6:9	ky2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים הִֽתְהַלֶּךְ נֹֽחַ	1	Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 5:22, 24. Alternate translation: “and he walked closely with God.” or “and he lived in a faithful relationship with God.”
6:10	vdjy			וַ⁠יּ֥וֹלֶד נֹ֖חַ	1	The fact that Noah fathered/had these three sons was already mentioned in Gen 5:32. Make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation does not sound like he fathered these sons a second time. Alternate translation: “Eventually he had” or “And as mentioned before, he had”
6:10	d1np			שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה בָנִ֑ים אֶת שֵׁ֖ם אֶת חָ֥ם וְ⁠אֶת יָֽפֶת	1	 Alternate translation: “three sons, namely Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”
6:11	f221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	The phrase **the earth** is often used in the Bible to refer to all the people on the earth. Consider whether your language can do the same thing, or whether it is necessary to make that implied information explicit. Alternate translation: “Now the people of the earth had become corrupt”
6:11	rpln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַ⁠תִּמָּלֵ֥א הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ חָמָֽס	1	This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause in order to emphasize how evil the people on the earth had become. The two clauses are different enough from each other that, if possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Also be consistent with how you translated **the earth** earlier in this verse. Alternate translation: “and they had filled the earth with their lawlessness.” or “and all over the earth they were doing lawless things.”
6:12	czxe			וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.

6:14	altn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	תֵּבַ֣ת	1	The term **ark** is general and refers to a chest/box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail and no rudder. Since this was a unique, one-of-a-kind boat that may already be well-known as the **ark** in the receptor language area, some translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the word **ark** throughout Genesis. Decide what is best for your translation. Alternate translation: “a very large houseboat”
6:14	tpc0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠ךָ֙	1	 Alternate translation: “for you and your family”

6:14	ch1i			בַּ⁠כֹּֽפֶר	1	The Hebrew word **covering** is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to “pitch” or “tar” or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking. Alternate translation: “with pitch to keep water out.” or “with pitch to keep the boat from leaking.”
6:15	qrn8			וְ⁠זֶ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “Build the ark with these dimensions” or “You must build the ark like this:”

You can: (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep **cubits** in the main text (so that the numbers 300, fifty/50 and thirty/30 are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote. Alternate translation: “It must be 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 14 meters high.” or “It must be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.”

See the note about **cubit** in verse 15. Alternate translation: “Build a skylight for the boat by finishing the sides of the ark to within one cubit below the top of the ark” or “Build a half-meter high window between the top of the sides of the ark and its roof all the way around, to let light and air in.”

6:18	s3cm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֶת בְּרִיתִ֖⁠י אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	This covenant is made up of the unconditional, unbreakable promises that God made to Noah (and all mankind and all other living things) in Genesis 8:2-9:17. The word “testament” is another word for “covenant,” so the way you translate **covenant** here could be similar to the way you translate the titles “Old Testament” and “New Testament.” Alternate translation: “a covenant between me and you,” or “a peace agreement between me and you,”

6:21	hpvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠אַתָּ֣ה	1	Although the pronoun **you** is singular in the Hebrew text in verse 21, it could be translated as plural, since God’s instructions apply to Noah and his family, not just Noah.

7:2	plj4			מִ⁠כֹּ֣ל הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֣ה הַ⁠טְּהוֹרָ֗ה	1	It may be necessary to include a footnote that explains the concept of clean and unclean animals: In the Bible a **clean animal** was an animal that was acceptable to be sacrificed to God or to be eaten, and an “unclean animal” was one that could not be sacrificed or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal was physically. Later Moses wrote down the laws about clean and unclean animals in the book of Leviticus. Alternate translation: “From every kind of pure animal” or “From every kind of animal that is acceptable to sacrifice”
7:2	f83c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תִּֽקַּח לְ⁠ךָ֛	1	The pronoun **you** is singular in the Hebrew text, but could be translated as a plural to include Noah’s family. Alternate translation: “bring with you”

7:4	dftv			לְ⁠יָמִ֨ים ע֜וֹד שִׁבְעָ֗ה	1	The phrase, **seven more days** could be translated “another week” here and in verse 11. However, it is probably best to keep the number seven in the text in both places, especially since the number seven often signifies perfection or completion in the Bible, perhaps also here. Alternate translation: “seven days from now”
7:4	xtx7			אָֽנֹכִי֙ מַמְטִ֣יר	1	 Alternate translation: “I will send rain”
7:4	tldc			עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	 Alternate translation: “all over the world”

Also see how you translated the idiom “son of … years” in Gen 5:32. Alternate translation: “He was 600 years old”

See how you translated a similar list of people in Gen 6:18. Alternate translation: “That is when Noah and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went together into the ark”
7:7	tiry			מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י	1	 Alternate translation: “because of” or “to escape from” or “to keep them safe from”

7:8	ca9u			וְ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר רֹמֵ֖שׂ עַל הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “including every kind of creature/animal that moves/lives on land,” or “which includes every kind of creature/animal that moves/lives on land,” According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 emphasizes that the clean and unclean animals and birds (verses 2-3, 8) were all creatures that lived on land (which are the creatures that the flood affected). Or it could mean: (2) “as well as every kind of creature/animal that crawls/creeps along the ground”. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 refers to a fourth category of creatures besides the clean animals, unclean animals, and birds.

7:10	e3k7			וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י	1	This phrase focuses attention on an important event (the beginning of the flood), and it builds suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: “Then”
7:10	v4ou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠שִׁבְעַ֣ת הַ⁠יָּמִ֑ים	1	This phrase refers to the seven days which God talked about in verse 4. It does not mean seven days after Noah and the animals went into the ark (verses 7-9); they went into the ark on the same day that the flood started (verse 13).

Make sure that a translation does not sound like this is the second (or third) time that Noah and his family and the animals entered the ark. Alternate translation: “So it was that on the very same day that the rain started,”
7:13	m0hx			נֹ֔חַ וְ⁠שֵׁם וְ⁠חָ֥ם וָ⁠יֶ֖פֶת בְּנֵי נֹ֑חַ וְ⁠אֵ֣שֶׁת נֹ֗חַ וּ⁠שְׁלֹ֧שֶׁת נְשֵֽׁי בָנָ֛י⁠ו אִתָּ֖⁠ם	1	See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 7. Alternate translation: “Noah and his wife and their sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their three wives all”

7:14	qs6f			וְ⁠כָל הַֽ⁠חַיָּ֣ה לְ⁠מִינָ֗⁠הּ וְ⁠כָל	1	In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It could mean: (1) “every kind of living thing/creature, including every” or (2) “every kind of wild animal, and every”.

It could mean: (1) “and every other kind of creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land,” which seems to fit this context best; or (2) “and every kind of creature/animal that crawls on the ground,”
7:14	hfxm			וְ⁠כָל הָ⁠ע֣וֹף לְ⁠מִינֵ֔⁠הוּ כֹּ֖ל צִפּ֥וֹר כָּל כָּנָֽף	1	This phrase probably refers not only to birds, but also to other creatures that have wings and fly, such as bats and insects. Alternate translation: “and every kind of bird and everything else that has wings.” or “and every kind of bird and every other kind of creature that flies.”

Also, if grapes are not known in your language area, you could say “vines/plants with a fruit called grapes”, or you could put in a footnote information about grapes, including how they are squeezed and how the juice is fermented to make wine. Alternate translation: “some grapevines and made wine from the grapes.” or “a field with grapevines. And he made wine from the grapes.”

9:24	e13r			וַ⁠יֵּ֕דַע	1	The text does not say how Noah found out about this, so it is best to not be too specific about that here in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he heard about”
9:24	k45l			אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר עָ֥שָׂה ל֖⁠וֹ בְּנ֥⁠וֹ הַ⁠קָּטָֽן	1	 Alternate translation: “that his youngest son Ham had disrespected him,”

9:25	bhhg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כְּנָ֑עַן	1	In verses 25-27, Canaan probably represents Ham and all of Ham’s descendants (the Canaanites), who will serve Shem and Japheth and all their descendants. You could put that information in a footnote.

9:25	dvbz			עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים	1	The Hebrew word here can mean either **slave** or “servant”.

9:26	a9c8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	בָּר֥וּךְ יְהֹוָ֖ה	1	Although many English translations have “Blessed be” here instead of “Praised be,” the word used in the Hebrew text means “praise” when people are acting towards God (as here), and it means “bless” when God is acting towards people (as in Gen 1:28; 5:2; 9:1).

9:28	j0sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַחַ֣ר הַ⁠מַּבּ֑וּל	1	Notice that this phrase refers to when the flood began, when Noah was 600 years old (Gen 7:6), not when it ended a year later, when he was 601 years old (8:13), since he was 950 when he died (verse 29), not 951. Alternate translation: “After the time that the flood began,” or “From the beginning of the flood,”
9:28	murg			וַֽ⁠יְחִי נֹ֖חַ & שְׁלֹ֤שׁ מֵאוֹת֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וַֽ⁠חֲמִשִּׁ֖ים שָׁנָֽה	1	 Alternate translation: “Noah lived 350 more years.”
9:29	zycm			וַ⁠יִּֽהְיוּ֙ כָּל יְמֵי נֹ֔חַ	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated Gen 5:31, which is similar to 9:29. Alternate translation: “so that Noah lived a total of 950 years,” or “So all together Noah lived 950 years,”

10:4	iwl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּתִּ֖ים וְ⁠דֹדָנִֽים	1	Most translation teams transliterate people group names in the Bible, but handle the suffix endings in different ways. For example, you could: (1) transliterate the Hebrew plural suffix “-im”; or (2) use a suffix that your language has for names of people groups (such as “-ites” in English); or (3) translate “-im” as “people” or “people/ethnic group.” Try to be consistent in how you handle people group names throughout this chapter and the rest of the book of Genesis. Alternate translation: “the Kitt people group and the Dodan people group.”
10:5	swml			מֵ֠⁠אֵלֶּה	1	This phrase probably refers to Japheth’s descendants (verses 2-4), especially since the descendants of his brothers Ham (verse 20) and Shem (verse 31) are summarized in a similar way.
10:5	ccp2			נִפְרְד֞וּ אִיֵּ֤י הַ⁠גּוֹיִם֙	1	 Alternate translation: “came the people groups who lived in regions beside the Mediterranean Sea. They moved to different places and settled”

10:5	hstu			אִ֖ישׁ לִ⁠לְשֹׁנ֑⁠וֹ	1	Consider whether it is more natural in your language to break up this long sentence and start a new sentence here (or later in this verse). Alternate translation: “They all spoke their own languages,”
10:5	yius			לְ⁠מִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	The word “clan” refers to a group of families who are descended from a common ancestor. Alternate translation: “and each of them lived in their own extended families,” or “They each had their own family groups,”
10:5	b8t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠גוֹיֵ⁠הֶֽם	1	The word **nations** refers here to people groups, not countries. Also, for some languages it may be clearer to change the order of the phrases in this verse and say, “Japheth’s descendants spread out and settled near/by the Mediterranean Sea. They all formed their own family groups, which grew/multiplied and became their own people groups that spoke their own languages and lived in their own territories/regions.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and they formed their own people groups.” or “which grew and became their own distinct ethnic groups.”
10:8	zwg5			וְ⁠כ֖וּשׁ יָלַ֣ד אֶת נִמְרֹ֑ד	1	See how you translated **fathered** in Gen 6:10, and how you translated a phrase in 10:1 (“were born to”) that has a similar meaning. Alternate translation: “Cush also fathered a son named Nimrod,”
10:8	k7ej			ה֣וּא הֵחֵ֔ל לִֽ⁠הְי֥וֹת	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “who was the first person/man/one to be” or (2) “who became”
10:8	kt9f			גִּבֹּ֖ר	1	There were other mighty men before Nimrod, but apparently he was the first one to have a kingdom (verse 10). Alternate translation: “a powerful warrior” or “a powerful king”
10:8	u6s3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier and say, “who was the first person/man on earth to be/become a powerful ruler/warrior.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “in the world.”
10:9	e8rh			הֽוּא הָיָ֥ה גִבֹּֽר צַ֖יִד	1	 Alternate translation: “Nimrod was also a excellent hunter”
10:9	fzr8			לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	 Alternate translation: “whom Yahweh helped.” or “because Yahweh helped him.”
10:9	vq2f			יֵֽאָמַ֔ר	1	This phrase indicates that what follows was a well-known saying that was used by people to praise or compliment other great men by comparing them to Nimrod. Alternate translation: “we have the saying about other great men:”

10:10	orky			בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ שִׁנְעָֽר	1	Shinar is another name for the land/country of Babylonia. You could put that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “which were all located in the land called Shinar.”
10:11	tmzb			מִן הָ⁠אָ֥רֶץ הַ⁠הִ֖וא	1	 Alternate translation: “From that region” or “From the land of Shinar”
10:11	jcf8			יָצָ֣א אַשּׁ֑וּר	1	See how you translated “the land/region of/called Asshur/Assyria” in Gen 2:14. Alternate translation: “he moved to the land called Asshur”

See what you did in verse 4. Also consider what is the best way in your language to list the names in these verses.

10:14	ylfj			וְֽ⁠אֶת פַּתְרֻסִ֞ים וְ⁠אֶת כַּסְלֻחִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָצְא֥וּ מִ⁠שָּׁ֛ם פְּלִשְׁתִּ֖ים וְ⁠אֶת כַּפְתֹּרִֽים	1	 Alternate translation: “Pathrusites, Casluhites (whom the Philistines came from), and Caphtorites.” or “Pathrusites, Casluhites, and Caphtorites. The Philistines came from the Casluhites.”

10:15	zjx9			וְ⁠אֶת חֵֽת	1	Canaan’s son Heth was the ancestor of the Hittites, so some translations use “Hittites” here instead and say, “He was also the ancestor of the Hittites,” Alternate translation: “then he had a son named Heth,”
10:16	uwbf			וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠יְבוּסִי֙ וְ⁠אֶת הָ֣⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י וְ⁠אֵ֖ת הַ⁠גִּרְגָּשִֽׁי	1	In verses 16-18, the people group names are singular collective nouns in Hebrew (in contrast to the people group names in verses 4, 13-14 that are plural nouns). Most English versions translate these names with a plural “-ites” suffix so that it is clear that these names refer to more than one person.

Do what is natural in your language here and elsewhere throughout the Bible. Alternate translation: “from Sidon City in the north,”
10:19	juim		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בֹּאֲ⁠כָ֥ה גְרָ֖רָ⁠ה עַד עַזָּ֑ה	1	The Canaanites’ border reached Gaza, but did not extend down to Gerar, which was farther south.

10:19	jenu			עַד לָֽשַׁע	1	 Alternate translation: “until you reach Lasha City.”
10:20	mrbd			אֵ֣לֶּה	1	The word **Those** refers back to the people listed in verses 6-19. Also, many translations that use “were” (and other past tense verbs) in verses 2-19 and 21-30 use **are** here (and in verses 31 and 32). Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Those are the names of” or “Those men are”

10:20	n9z9			לִ⁠לְשֹֽׁנֹתָ֑⁠ם בְּ⁠אַרְצֹתָ֖⁠ם בְּ⁠גוֹיֵ⁠הֶֽם	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated verse 5, which has some of the same phrases as verse 20. Alternate translation: “Each family spoke its own language and lived in its own territory and eventually became its own people group.” or “Each family multiplied and established its own ethnic group that had its own language and lived in its own region.”
10:21	am4z			וּ⁠לְ⁠שֵׁ֥ם יֻלַּ֖ד גַּם	1	In the Hebrew text, **to Shem** comes first in this sentence after **And**, to emphasize Shem. Do what is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Shem also fathered some sons”
10:21	f29s			אֲחִ֖י יֶ֥פֶת הַ⁠גָּדֽוֹל	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “and his/Shem’s older brother was Japheth.” (2) “and he/Shem was Japheth’s older/oldest brother.”

Alternate translation: “Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram.”
10:23	qqox			ע֥וּץ וְ⁠ח֖וּל וְ⁠גֶ֥תֶר וָ⁠מַֽשׁ	1	The same person who is called **Mash** here, is referred to as “Meshech/Meshek” in 1 Chronicles 1:17. To prevent confusion, some translations use “Meshech/Meshek” here too, or they put that name in a footnote.
10:24	u3c2			וְ⁠אַרְפַּכְשַׁ֖ד יָלַ֣ד אֶת שָׁ֑לַח	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled “Arpachshad/Arphaxad” in verse 22. Alternate translation: “Arphaxad had a son named Shelah,”

10:25	ibtk			פֶּ֗לֶג	1	You can put the meaning of Peleg’s name in the text or in a footnote, so that it is clear why he was given his name. See what you did for a similar case (Noah’s name) in Gen 5:29.
10:25	v3na		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נִפְלְגָ֣ה הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	This phrase refers to the people on the earth and implies that they scattered and lived all over the earth (as specified in Gen 11:8).

10:30	buoh			סְפָ֖רָ⁠ה	1	Sephar might refer to a city, a mountain, or a region (that was named after the city or mountain). Alternate translation: “the town of Sephar, which is in”
10:30	bl54			הַ֥ר הַ⁠קֶּֽדֶם	1	The word **mountains** is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It can be: (1) a collective noun that refers to mountains or hill country near the town of Sephar; or (2) a singular noun that refers to a specific mountain that was called Sephar. Alternate translation: “the mountain range that is in the east.” or “the eastern hill country.”

10:32	nh8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠מֵ⁠אֵ֜לֶּה נִפְרְד֧וּ הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֛ם בָּ⁠אָ֖רֶץ אַחַ֥ר הַ⁠מַּבּֽוּל	1	Consider again how you translated **nations** in verses 5, 20, 31-32. Alternate translation: “From those people came all the ethnic groups who spread out over the earth after the flood.”
11:1	r2b8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י כָל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ שָׂפָ֣ה אֶחָ֑ת	1	The events in chapter 11:1-9 happened before the people listed in chapter 10 had their own languages and before they spread out over the earth (Gen 10:5, 19-20, 30-32). You could include some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Now at first, everyone on the earth shared the same language” or “Now for a while, all the people on the earth spoke one language”
11:1	l2n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וּ⁠דְבָרִ֖ים אֲחָדִֽים	1	The phrases **one language** and **the same words** are very similar in meaning and emphasize the fact that everyone spoke the same language. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: “and shared the same vocabulary.” or “and spoke words everyone knew”
11:2	ufks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י	1	The phrase “it happened that” introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Some translations omit this phrase because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “After a while, as” or “When”
11:2	phjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠נָסְעָ֣⁠ם	1	Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun (**they**) or a noun phrase (“the people”) here. Alternate translation: “they traveled” or “the people moved”
11:2	kqit			מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	At first after the flood, people lived in the regions around the mountains of Ararat (where the ark had landed). As they began to migrate and spread out to different places (as God had told them to do), they must have headed south at some point since they ended up at the plain of Shinar, which was south of where the Ararat Mountains were. The reference to **the east** probably reflects the viewpoint of the author (Moses), since the Ararat mountains and the plain of Shinar were both far to the east of where he was living. Alternate translation: “around in the eastern regions,”
11:2	zdwp			וַֽ⁠יִּמְצְא֥וּ	1	Make sure the way you translate this phrase fits with the way you translated the first half of this verse. Alternate translation: “they discovered” or “they eventually came to”
11:2	vygx			בִקְעָ֛ה בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ שִׁנְעָ֖ר	1	This plain was a wide, flat area between mountains. Also be consistent here with how you translated **land of Shinar** in Gen 10:10. Alternate translation: “a wide flat area in the land called Shinar”
11:2	dxfo			וַ⁠יֵּ֥שְׁבוּ שָֽׁם	1	 Alternate translation: “and lived there.” or “and began to live there.”
11:3	m2g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֗⁠הוּ	1	The events that are described below probably did not happen immediately after they arrived at the plain.

11:4	z87w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נַֽעֲשֶׂה לָּ֖⁠נוּ שֵׁ֑ם פֶּן נָפ֖וּץ	1	The phrase **make a name for ourselves** is a idiom. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also see how you translated the word **scattered** in Gen 10:18, 32. Alternate translation: “We should do that to make ourselves famous and to keep us from spreading out” or “That way we will become well-known and we will not separate from each other and live”

11:5	oe6q			לִ⁠רְאֹ֥ת אֶת הָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	The text implies that Yahweh actually looked at the city. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to make that explicit here. Alternate translation: “and inspected the city”
11:5	pbs0			וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠מִּגְדָּ֑ל	1	See how you translated this word in verse 4.
11:5	zcoi			בָּנ֖וּ	1	Make sure the way you translate this verb fits with the fact that the people had not yet finished building the city (verse 8). Alternate translation: “had started building.”
11:6	zesy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. Alternate translation: “And he said (to himself),” or “He said,”
11:6	h94b			הֵ֣ן	1	This term calls attention to what Yahweh says next. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.
11:6	q2ld			עַ֤ם אֶחָד֙	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “they are one people/ethnic group,” or (2) “the/these people are one/united in what they are doing,”
11:6	emr9			וְ⁠שָׂפָ֤ה אַחַת֙ לְ⁠כֻלָּ֔⁠ם	1	See how you translated **have one language** in verse 1. Alternate translation: “and they all share the same language.”

Consider what is the best way to translate this in your language. Alternate translation: “nothing that they plan to do will be impossible for them.” or “anything they attempt to do will be possible for them.” or “they will be able to do whatever they try to do.”
11:7	siye			הָ֚בָ⁠ה	1	 Alternate translation: “So come on,”
11:7	ab2t			נֵֽרְדָ֔ה & שָׁ֖ם	1	Most Bible scholars think the plural pronoun **us** refers here to God and the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep this plural pronoun in your translation. See what you did for similar pronouns in Gen 1:26. Alternate translation: “let us go to them”
11:7	b6e9			וְ⁠נָבְלָ֥ה & שְׂפָתָ֑⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “and scramble their language”
11:7	qlnr			אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ	1	 Alternate translation: “so that they will not be able to understand” or “so that they cannot understand”

11:8	fvq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	For some languages it is better to change the order of clauses in this verse (so that events are in the order that they happened) and say, “In that way, Yahweh caused the people to stop building the city and the tower and to move away from each other, so that eventually they lived all over the world.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “the city and the tower.”
11:9	grok			קָרָ֤א שְׁמָ⁠הּ֙	1	Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific. Alternate translation: “people named the city” or “the name of that city is” or “the city was named”

Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Arpachshad/Arphaxad” in Gen 10:22. Alternate translation: “Two years after the flood began, when Shem was 100 years old, he had a son named Arphaxad.”
11:11	hhxi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יְחִי שֵׁ֗ם אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣⁠וֹ אֶת אַרְפַּכְשָׁ֔ד	1	Throughout this section, make sure that names and pronouns (like **he**) are used in a way that is accurate and natural in your language, so that it is always clear who is being referred to. Alternate translation: “After he had Arphaxad, he lived” or “After Arphaxad was born, Shem lived”
11:11	newn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה	1	See how you translated Gen 5:7, which has the same sentence structure as 11:11. For some languages, it may be more natural to change the clause order of this sentence and say, “Shem lived 500 more years after Arpachshad/Arphaxad was born …” Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: “500 more years,”
11:11	e9d9			וַ⁠יּ֥וֹלֶד	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this phrase and the following one in Gen 5:4. Alternate translation: “and he also had” or “Shem also had” or “He was also the father of”
11:11	lc2z			בָּנִ֖ים וּ⁠בָנֽוֹת	1	 Alternate translation: “other sons as well as daughters.”
11:12	cx5o			וְ⁠אַרְפַּכְשַׁ֣ד חַ֔י חָמֵ֥שׁ וּ⁠שְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה	1	Make sure that your translation of this clause does not mean that Arpachshad only lived to be thirty-five years old. Also, throughout this chapter, be consistent with how you have decided to handle numbers in the Bible. For example, many translation teams use words for single and double-digit numbers, but use numerals for larger numbers. This strategy helps prevent confusion with verse numbers. This is especially true in translations that use a large font size for verse numbers so that people doing group Bible study can easily see the numbers and be in the same verse together. See what you did in chapter 5. Alternate translation: “When Arphaxad had lived 35 years,” or “When Arphaxad was 35 years old,”
11:12	wvlk			וַ⁠יּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת שָֽׁלַח	1	See how you translated Gen 5:6, which has the same sentence structure as 11:12. Alternate translation: “he fathered a son named Shelah.” or “he fathered a son they named Shelah.” or “he fathered a son whose name was Shelah.”

11:26	fa4t			וַֽ⁠יְחִי־תֶ֖רַח שִׁבְעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה	1	Your translation needs to allow for the fact that Terah’s sons were not triplets (just as Noah’s sons were not triplets; see Gen 5:32), rather he started having children after he turned seventy and his sons were born in different years after that. In fact, Abram was not born until Terah was at least 130 years old (11:32, 12:4-5; Acts 7:4), and he was probably Terah’s youngest son. Abram is listed first (instead of Haran or Nahor) probably because of his importance as the one whom Yahweh made His covenant with. Some of this information could be put in a footnote. Alternate translation: “After Terah had lived 70 years,” or “After Terah turned 70 years old,”

11:28	la6c			בְּ⁠א֥וּר כַּשְׂדִּֽים	1	The word **Kasdim** probably comes from the name of one of Nahor’s sons, Kesed (Gen 22:22), and often refers to the Chaldeans who were a people group that lived in the country of Babylonia (where Ur was located). Alternate translation: “in the city of Ur which was ruled by the Kasdim” or “in the city of Ur where the Kasdim people lived.”

12:3	yvsd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠ךָ֔	1	This phrase refers to Abram and his descendants, including ultimately the Messiah. In other words, God’s promise in this verse is part of his wonderful news (the Gospel message) for all people (Galatians 3:8-9) and is a prophecy about the Messiah/Christ, who was one of Abraham’s descendants (Matthew 1:1, Genesis 22:18, Galatians 3:16). God blessed all people on earth by sending his Son Jesus (the Messiah/Christ) to die in their place and pay for all their sins (John 3:16-18, 1 Timothy 2:3-6), so that they could have a close relationship with him/God and be part of his family forever. God repeats this great promise in Genesis 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Through you and your offspring” or “Because of you and your offspring” or “By means of you and your offspring”
12:3	yt58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִבְרְכ֣וּ & כֹּ֖ל מִשְׁפְּחֹ֥ת הָ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this passive sentence.

Alternate translation: “all the people on the earth will be blessed by me.” or “I will bless all the people on the earth.”

Alternate translation: “Then Abram left the city of Haran, just as Yahweh had told him to do,” or “Then Abram did what Yahweh had told him to do and left the city of Haran,”

12:4	p63p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠אַבְרָ֗ם	1	Many translations omit the conjunction **And** or “Now” here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Now Abram”

12:5	t055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶת ל֣וֹט בֶּן אָחִ֗י⁠ו	1	For some languages it is more natural to make **son of his brother** or “his nephew” explicit in verse 4 (where Lot is first mentioned in this section) and leave it implied here in verse 5. Do what is best in your language.
12:5	af34			וְ⁠אֶת כָּל רְכוּשָׁ⁠ם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָכָ֔שׁוּ וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠נֶּ֖פֶשׁ אֲשֶׁר עָשׂ֣וּ	1	The word **possessions** is general here and includes slaves, animals, furniture, clothes, and money. See how you translated “slave” or “servant” in Gen 9:25-27. Alternate translation: “everything that they owned, including slaves and everything else they had gotten”
12:5	v8yx			בְ⁠חָרָ֑ן	1	“in the city of Haran,” or “in Haran City
12:5	iazy			אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה כְּנַ֔עַן	1	 Alternate translation: “to the land called Canaan.” or “to Canaan Land.”

12:6	ep53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֤ר אַבְרָם֙	1	Abram is the only one named here because he is in focus. However, your translation should not sound like he traveled alone in verse 6. Also make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation fits with the way you ended verse 5. Alternate translation: “Abram went” or “Abram and his family went” or “they went”
12:6	o804			בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	See how you translated **land** in verse 5. Alternate translation: “through that land”
12:6	ai2i			עַ֚ד	1	 Alternate translation: “until they arrived at”
12:6	klyk			מְק֣וֹם שְׁכֶ֔ם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “the city of Shechem,” or (2) “the/a sacred place at/near the city of Shechem,”
12:6	wf66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עַ֖ד אֵל֣וֹן מוֹרֶ֑ה	1	Moreh is probably the name of the person who owned the land where the terebinth tree was. A terebinth tree is a large, broadleaf, flowering tree in the cashew family that can grow to a height of 5 to 12 meters (16 to 40 feet). The Hebrew words for “oak” and **terebinth** are similar, so many translations (including LXX) translate this as “oak tree” here. Notice, however, that oak trees and terebinth trees are from two different families of trees.
12:6	aje0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֖י אָ֥ז בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put the time phrase (**at that time**) first in this sentence. Alternate translation: “At that time the Canaanites were still living in that region,”
12:7	nqjy			וַ⁠יֵּרָ֤א יְהוָה֙ אֶל אַבְרָ֔ם	1	Yahweh’s promise in verse 7 to give Canaan to Abram’s descendants contrasts with the fact that the Canaanites were still occupying that region (verse 6). Also, notice that the text does not specify in what form or in what way God appeared to Abram, so your translation should not do that either. Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh came to Abram” or “but Yahweh visited Abram”
12:7	nsz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	 Alternate translation: “and promised to him,”
12:7	zfqw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לְ⁠זַ֨רְעֲ⁠ךָ֔ אֶתֵּ֖ן אֶת הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֑את	1	In the Hebrew text, the phrase “to your offspring” is emphasized by its position at the beginning of this quote. However, for some languages it may be clearer and more natural to change the order of the clauses and say, “I will give this land to your offspring/descendants.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “I will give this land to your offspring”
12:7	ed0y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּ֤בֶן & מִזְבֵּ֔חַ	1	Consider what is the best way to refer to Abram here in your language. See how you translated **altar** in Gen 8:20.

12:8	u3l7			וַ⁠יֵּ֣ט אָהֳלֹ֑⁠ה	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “tent” in Gen 9:21, 27. Alternate translation: “and put up his tents there” or “They set up their camp”
12:8	r71q			בֵּֽית אֵ֤ל מִ⁠יָּם֙ וְ⁠הָ⁠עַ֣י מִ⁠קֶּ֔דֶם	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Bethel was to the west of them and the town of Ai was to the east.”

12:9	yypr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נֶּֽגְבָּ⁠ה	1	The Hebrew word **Negev** can mean “south” or “dry country,” so some translations translate the meaning. But most translations transliterate the Hebrew name (as **Negev** or “Negeb”) as they do with other names in the Bible. Alternate translation: “south toward the Negev Wilderness” or “southward until they reached the Southern Wilderness”
12:10	glm2			וַ⁠יְהִ֥י	1	This clause gives the setting for the rest of the sentence. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.
12:10	eik8			רָעָ֖ב	1	A **famine** is a prolonged period of time when people are starving because crops are failing, often due to a lack of rain or other severe weather conditions. Alternate translation: “a serious lack of food” or “a hungry time when food was very scarce”

12:10	rz12			וַ⁠יֵּ֨רֶד אַבְרָ֤ם	1	This phrase refers to the fact that Egypt is lower in elevation than Canaan (verse 5). It is also located southwest of Canaan. Alternate translation: “so Abram and his family traveled southwest” or “so Abram and his family moved further south”

12:10	vjke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause near the beginning of this verse and say, “Then/Now there was a famine in that land/region that was so heavy/severe/bad that Abram and his family left there and went down to the land/country of Egypt to live for a while.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “in that land” or “in the Negev Desert so they could not survive there.”

12:13	kbgh			וְ⁠חָיְתָ֥ה נַפְשִׁ֖⁠י בִּ⁠גְלָלֵֽ⁠ךְ	1	For some languages it is not natural to include the phrase **because of you** here, because it repeats the same idea as **for your sake** in the previous clause.

12:15	twfq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ אֹתָ⁠הּ֙ שָׂרֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	The term **officials** is general and refers to leaders or rulers who were under Pharaoh and served him. Also, the term **Pharaoh** is an Egyptian title that refers to the king or ruler over Egypt. However, in the Old Testament, it is treated as a name (that frequently occurs with the title “king of Egypt”), so translators often transliterate **Pharaoh** (which is how other names in the Bible are normally treated). Some languages require an honorific title with the names of kings, for example, “King Pharaoh”. Decide how you will handle this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Some of the officers who ruled under the Egyptian king spotted her, so” or “When some officials of Pharaoh the king of Egypt saw her,”

Because of the power of spoken words, people left that part to be understood silently. You could supply these words if it would be clearer and not offensive in your language. Alternate translation: “if from a thread even to the strap of a sandal, or I take from anything that {belongs} to you, may Yahweh punish me severely” or “…may Yahweh strike me dead”
14:23	lbqa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	מִ⁠חוּט֙ וְ⁠עַ֣ד שְׂרֽוֹךְ נַ֔עַל	1	 Abram is mentioning things that are so small and insignificant that no one would want them in order to make the point that he doesn't want anything from the king of Sodom. Alternate translation: “even a thread or the strap from a sandal,” or “even something as small as a piece of string or a sandal strap”
14:23	wb28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠אִם אֶקַּ֖ח מִ⁠כָּל	1	This clause emphasizes Abram’s point by repeating the meaning of the previous phrase in different words. Consider what is the best way to emphasize a point in your language. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No I will not keep anything”
14:23	ah9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	For some languages, it may be clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “that I will not keep/accept anything that belongs to you or your people, not even something as small as a piece of thread/string or the strap from a sandal.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “that belongs to you or your people,”

Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like what Abram saw was unreal; what he saw and heard actually happened. Alternate translation: “Yahweh appeared to Abram visually and said to him,”
15:1	a97c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָנֹכִי֙ מָגֵ֣ן לָ֔⁠ךְ	1	God is like a shield to Abram since he protects him.

15:1	dbve			שְׂכָרְ⁠ךָ֖ הַרְבֵּ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “and your reward from me will be very great.” or “and I will give you a very great/valuable reward/gift.” (2) “and I am your very great/valuable reward.” The context (verse 2) shows that the first interpretation is what Abram understood God to be saying.
15:2	vwfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָ֗ם	1	The way you translate this quote margin may depend on how you translate the following rhetorical question. Alternate translation: “Then Abram said to him,” or “Then Abram asked him,”

15:2	dltw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠בֶן מֶ֣שֶׁק	1	The phrase **son of the inheritance** is used here as an idiom that means “inheritor” or “heir”; it does not refer to an actual son.

Alternate translation: “so that after I die, the heir of” or “So when I die, the one who will own”
15:2	gn01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בֵּיתִ֔⁠י	1	This phrase refers here to all Abram’s belongings. Alternate translation: “my estate” or “all that I own”
15:2	nc22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	דַּמֶּ֥שֶׂק אֱלִיעֶֽזֶר	1	In the Hebrew text, Abram emphasizes the fact that Eliezer was from Damascus, which means he was a foreigner from a foreign city, not a blood relative. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “the city of Damascus” in Gen 14:15. Alternate translation: “is my foreign servant Eliezer from Damascus”
15:3	jv86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָ֔ם	1	Some languages omit these words, because the same speaker is still speaking to the same audience. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Then he added,”

15:5	gdld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠ח֗וּצָ⁠ה	1	Abram was probably inside a tent, not inside a house. But if possible, it is best to leave this implied in a translation (as the Hebrew text does).
15:5	vwsk			הַבֶּט נָ֣א	1	See how you translated “please” in Gen 13:14. Make sure your translation does not sound like God is begging. Alternate translation: “Now look up”

15:10	haes			וַ⁠יִּֽקַּֽח	1	It was nighttime in verse 5 when Abram looked at the stars. Now in verses 10-11 it was probably daytime, which is when birds of prey fly (verse 11).

15:10	rm6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ל֣⁠וֹ אֶת כָּל אֵ֗לֶּה	1	Some languages need to make explicit that Abram killed the animals first, before cutting them in half. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “all those animals to him and killed them.”

However, it is best to translate the clause as literally as possible, since it implies the important information that people are still alive after they have died on earth.

Alternate translation: “you will be at peace when you die and join your forefathers who have gone before you”

For some languages it is overly redundant to repeat that phrase, and so they leave it implied here. However, if possible, it is best to keep this repetition in your translation.

16:8	aajb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֗ר	1	The angel asked Hagar a question, so for some languages it is better to use a word like “asked” here. Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. Alternate translation: “And the angel said to her,” or “The angel asked her,”

However, the repeated quote margins could be there to emphasize what the angel says next and/or to show that he paused or that he is changing the topic. Alternate translation: “Then the angel told her,” or “Then he added”
16:10	un14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַרְבָּ֥ה אַרְבֶּ֖ה אֶת זַרְעֵ֑⁠ךְ	1	The pronoun **I** refers to Yahweh here.

16:11	tezq			יִשְׁמָעֵ֔אל	1	Some translation teams make the meaning of Ishmael’s name explicit in their translation. Other teams put the meaning of his name in a footnote. See what you did for similar cases in Gen 3:20, 4:1, 16, 25; 6:29, 10:25, 11:9.
16:11	q8bz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּֽי שָׁמַ֥ע יְהוָ֖ה אֶל	1	If you include the meaning of Ishmael’s name earlier in this verse, make sure it fits with how you translate this clause. Alternate translation: “because Yahweh heard” or “because Yahweh paid attention to”

16:12	y6tx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠עַל־פְּנֵ֥י & יִשְׁכֹּֽן	1	The rest of this verse forms a parallelism with the first half, emphasizing what Ishmael (and his descendants) will be like. Try to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation, since each part has a different focus and the second part adds important information. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Yes he will even fight against”

16:14	x357			קָרָ֣א לַ⁠בְּאֵ֔ר	1	Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific. Also, this well is the same as the spring in verse 7. For some languages, it may be necessary to translate these words the same way so that it is clear that they refer to the same place. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “the well is named” or “people call that well” or “the name of the well is”

17:1	ph7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֲנִי אֵ֣ל שַׁדַּ֔י	1	Most translation teams translate the meaning of God’s title here (**God Almighty**). A few teams transliterate the title as “El Shaddai” (as if it were a personal name) and put the meaning of the title in a footnote. Abram already knew that God’s personal name is Yahweh (Gen 12:8; 15:7-8), so he would have understood that God was using a title here (not a personal name). The title **God Almighty** emphasizes God’s authority and power. You could include a transliteration of this title in a footnote. Alternate translation: “I am Almighty God.” or “I am the all-powerful God.”

Also, consider again how you translated **circumcised** in verses 10-14, 23-27.
18:1	xaic			וַ⁠יֵּרָ֤א אֵלָי⁠ו֙ יְהוָ֔ה	1	See how you translated **appeared** in Gen 12:7 and 17:1.

18:1	grq0			פֶּֽתַח הָ⁠אֹ֖הֶל	1	The entrance to the tent was an opening that could be closed by a large piece of cloth or animal skin. It did not have a solid wood door like a house has. See how you translated **tent** in Gen 4:20. Alternate translation: “at the doorway of his tent” or “by the front of his tent”
18:1	x2ic			כְּ⁠חֹ֥ם הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	 Alternate translation: “during the hot time of the day.”

18:2	ceux			עָלָ֑י⁠ו	1	Translate this phrase in a way that fits with the fact that the men were far enough away from Abraham that he could run over to them (as he did in the next sentence). Alternate translation: “not too far away from him.”

18:3	i1yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics	אֲדֹנָ֗⁠י	1	Abraham uses **lords** here as a polite address to the three men. The Hebrew word “lord” can also be a reference to God, but notice that at this point Abraham probably thought he was talking to men or angels. It wasn’t until later that he realized that one of them was Yahweh (verse 14). Alternate translation: “My masters,” or “Gentlemen,”
18:3	f44a			אִם נָ֨א מָצָ֤אתִי חֵן֙ בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	The pronoun **your** is singular here in the Hebrew text, and also in the next clause.

Alternate translation: “Let my servants bring you some water,”
18:4	ygvl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠רַחֲצ֖וּ רַגְלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	People wore sandals and their feet would get dusty when they traveled. So it was customary to offer guests water to wash the dust off their feet. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. Also, notice that the pronouns **you** and **your** are plural here in the Hebrew text. Alternate translation: “That way you all can wash the dust off your feet”

18:5	dabs			וְ⁠אֶקְחָ֨ה	1	 Alternate translation: “I will also get you” or “Let me also get you”
18:5	w6hc			פַת	1	Saying **a morsel** was a polite way of showing generosity. Make sure your translation does not sound here like Abraham was only offering the men a tiny bit of bread; he was going to give them plenty of food to eat. Alternate translation: “a little bit of”
18:5	qih5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֶ֜חֶם	1	Since bread was a common staple of their diet, it is often used in the Bible to refer to food in general. Alternate translation: “bread for you to eat.”

18:6	vfdt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שְׁלֹ֤שׁ סְאִים֙	1	It is not certain how much **three seahs** was, but it is thought that it was more than 20 quarts/liters. It was enough flour to make bread for many people, just as the calf (verse 7) provided enough meat for many people and showed generous hospitality. Besides Abraham’s guests, others in his household may have also joined in eating the feast. Alternate translation: “three large scoops”
18:6	yzn0			קֶ֣מַח סֹ֔לֶת	1	 Alternate translation: “of good quality flour.” or “of the best flour.”
18:6	ygf6			ל֖וּשִׁי וַ⁠עֲשִׂ֥י עֻגֽוֹת	1	The Hebrew word for **loaves** here is often translated “cakes”, which probably refers to their flat, round shape (similar to biscuits). However, make sure your translation of this word does not sound like a dessert, because this bread was not sweet. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Knead the dough and make it into loaves” or “and bake some loaves of flat bread.” or “and make some bread.”

Many languages can use **they** or “the men” in the same way. Make sure your translation of this quote margin does not sound like all three of the men spoke at the same time. Alternate translation: “Then one of the men asked him”

18:10	s103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּ⁠עֵ֣ת חַיָּ֔ה	1	For some languages it may be more natural to move this time phrase to the beginning of this quote and say, “Next year at this time I will surely/definitely return …” Do what is best in your language.

18:10	yh3k			בֵ֖ן לְ⁠שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	This means that Sarah would have a son with her when Yahweh returns. It does not mean that she would give birth at that time. Alternate translation: “your wife Sarah will have a baby boy with her.” or “your wife Sarah will already have a baby son”

18:11	oz4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֤ם וְ⁠שָׂרָה֙	1	This verse gives background information that is important to what happens next. Some languages use a conjunction such as **Now** here to introduce this kind of information, while other languages omit the conjunction, especially if **Now** is used to begin the last sentence in verse 10.

18:12	he9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַֽ⁠אדֹנִ֖⁠י זָקֵֽן	1	The phrase **my lord** is a title of respect that Sarah uses to refer to Abraham as her husband. Also, for some languages it may be better to change the order of some of the clauses in this verse and say, “I am too old to conceive and my husband is also very/too old! How can I possibly still have/experience the pleasure of having a child?” or “It doesn’t seem possible that I could have/experience the pleasure of having a child now that I am too old to conceive. Besides that, my husband is also very/too old!” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Besides that, my master is also too old!”

Consider whether or not it is best to use rhetorical questions here in your language. Alternate translation: “Why did Sarah laugh to herself and say” or “Sarah should not have laughed and thought to herself,” or “Sarah should not have laughed, thinking,”

19:7	fcre		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	נָ֥א אַחַ֖⁠י	1	The phrase **my brothers** is used here as a polite address that implies a close relationship.

19:22	p51q			כִּ֣י לֹ֤א אוּכַל֙ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֣וֹת	1	This clause implies that Yahweh will not allow the angel to destroy anything until Lot and his family arrive safely in the town of Zoar. Alternate translation: “because I am not allowed to do anything” or “because I must wait to do anything” or “because God will not allow me to do anything”
19:22	iw13			עַד בֹּאֲ⁠ךָ֖ שָׁ֑מָּ⁠ה	1	 Alternate translation: “until you reach there safely.” or “until you are safely there.”

19:25	euza			וְ⁠אֵ֖ת כָּל הַ⁠כִּכָּ֑ר	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were also in the plain/valley, not separate from it. Alternate translation: “and the whole valley,” or “and the rest of the plain”

20:9	y075			מַעֲשִׂים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא יֵֽעָשׂ֔וּ עָשִׂ֖יתָ עִמָּדִֽ⁠י	1	 Alternate translation: “No one should ever wrong someone the way you have wronged me!”
20:10	y1ly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֲבִימֶ֖לֶךְ אֶל אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	For some languages it is more natural here to omit this quote margin, because the same person is still talking to the same person. However, the words emphasize what King Abimelech says next and may indicate that there was a pause between what he said in verse 9 and in verse 10. Do what is best in your language.

It is a complex term that means to recognize how holy and powerful God is and to deeply respect and honor him by obeying and worshiping him. Also, consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Alternate translation: “I thought that there was certainly no one in this place who obeyed God, so I was afraid that they would kill me in order to take my wife for themselves.”

Rather people paid each other with shekels of silver or gold shekels, which was a weight measurement. A thousand shekels of silver was about 25 pounds (11.5 kilos) of silver. Many translation teams like to keep the same numbers that are in the Hebrew text in their translation, and then in a footnote give the equivalent amount in their own currency. Other teams put the equivalent amount in the text and put the literal phrase in a footnote. Alternate translation: “I have given 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother.” or “I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver.”

20:18	lzt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	שָׂרָ֖ה אֵ֥שֶׁת אַבְרָהָֽם	1	For some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence (which begins in verse 17) and say, “Before this, Yahweh had completely closed up every womb in the household of King Abimelech because he had taken Abraham’s wife Sarah. Then Abraham prayed …” If the order is changed, it will be necessary to combine these two verses and to put the verse numbers “17-18” in front of the sentence. Some translation teams have decided that they will never combine verses like that. Other teams have decided that occasionally it is acceptable to do that if it makes the meaning clearer.
21:1	ia7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יהוָ֛ה פָּקַ֥ד אֶת שָׂרָ֖ה כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָמָ֑ר	1	The word **visited** is used here as an idiom that means God blessed Sarah and was kind to her (by enabling her to have a son).

Alternate translation: “Do not be afraid, because God has heard the cries of the boy where he is lying and will take care of him.” or “Do not be afraid. God has heard the youth crying over there and will take care of him.” or “God has heard the youth crying over there, so do not be afraid because he will take care of you both.”
21:18	xxt8			ק֚וּמִי שְׂאִ֣י אֶת הַ⁠נַּ֔עַר	1	 Alternate translation: “So go help the youth to stand up,” or “So now, go to your son, help him get up,”

21:18	l3mg			כִּֽי & אֲשִׂימֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	The pronoun **I** refers to Yahweh here. So either Yahweh had taken on the form of an angel, or the angel was representing Yahweh and speaking for him. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 16:10. Also, see how you translated “make … into a great nation” in verse 13. Also see 18:18, which is similar. Alternate translation: “because Yahweh will make his descendants become”
21:18	yl2m			לְ⁠ג֥וֹי גָּד֖וֹל	1	See how you translated **nation** in verse 13. Alternate translation: “an large ethnic group.”

Consider whether or not your language has an idiom that fits well here. Also consider again how you translated “boy/youth” in verses 12, 17-20. Alternate translation: “God was with the boy and blessed him,”
21:20	x2tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יִּגְדָּ֑ל וַ⁠יֵּ֨שֶׁב֙	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse and say, “As the boy/youth grew up/older, God was with him and helped/blessed him.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “as he grew up”
21:20	s0rv			וַ⁠יֵּ֨שֶׁב֙ בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּ֔ר	1	For some languages it is more natural to specify here in verse 20 that the name of the wilderness is Paran, rather than wait until verse 21, so that it is clear that both verses refer to the same wilderness. See how you translated **the wilderness** in verse 14. Alternate translation: “And he lived in the desert of Paran” or “He lived in the Paran Wilderness”
21:20	n9h4			וַ⁠יְהִ֖י רֹבֶ֥ה קַשָּֽׁת	1	 Alternate translation: “and became a skilled bowhunter”

Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “King Abimelech went with his army commander Phicol to Abraham and said to him,” or “King Abimelech and his army commander Phicol went to Abraham and said to him,”
21:22	zrmj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֱלֹהִ֣ים עִמְּ⁠ךָ֔ בְּ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר אַתָּ֖ה עֹשֶֽׂה	1	See how you translated a similar phrase (“God was with …”) in verse 20. Alternate translation: “I have noticed that God is with you and blesses you in everything that you do.”
21:23	dapc			וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	King Abimelech’s words to Abraham should sound polite and respectful in your translation, not rude or demanding. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 20:7. Alternate translation: “So now, please”
21:23	k01e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	הִשָּׁ֨בְעָ⁠ה לִּ֤⁠י בֵֽ⁠אלֹהִים֙ הֵ֔נָּה	1	To “swear … by God” means that Abraham would be accountable to God, asking him to be his witness and to punish him if he breaks his oath/vow/promise to King Abimelech. It does not mean that Abraham used swear words or other foul language. If this custom is not familiar to many people in your language area, you could put this information in a footnote. See how you translated a similar sentence in Gen 14:22. Alternate translation: “solemnly promise me here with God as your witness”
21:23	iy8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם־תִּשְׁקֹ֣ר לִ֔⁠י	1	According to custom, Abimelech is leaving out the part of the oath that tells what Yahweh will do to Abraham if he violates the oath. Because of the power of spoken words, people left that part to be understood silently. You could supply these words if it would be clearer and not offensive in your language.  Alternate translation: “that he will punish you severely if you deal falsely with me”
21:23	gd6n			כַּ⁠חֶ֜סֶד אֲשֶׁר עָשִׂ֤יתִי עִמְּ⁠ךָ֙	1	 Alternate translation: “Rather, just as I have treated you kindly,” or “But just as I have been kind to you,”

21:25	ngd9			אֶת אֲבִימֶ֑לֶךְ	1	For some languages, it is necessary to include the title “King” every time that Abimelech (or any other king) is referred to by name. For other languages, it is more natural to use the title only occasionally (especially when the focus is on him), or perhaps only the first time he is referred to in a section (so that his status is clear). Do what is best in your language throughout this section.

21:31	ace1			קָרָ֛א לַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	The phrase **he called** often means that people in general gave a city or other place a certain name. Here it could be that Abraham named the place Beersheba, and then later other people called it the same name, and it became well known by that name. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 19:22. Alternate translation: “Abraham called that place” or “they call that place” or “that place was called”
21:31	h7pp			בְּאֵ֣ר שָׁ֑בַע	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Beersheba** in verse 14. Also, if you include the meaning of the name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure that the way you translate “vow” or **oath** here matches the way you translate **oath** later in this verse.

21:32	qzuk			אֶל אֶ֥רֶץ פְּלִשְׁתִּֽים	1	Abimelech and Phicol probably returned to their homes in the city of Gerar (Gen 20:2), which at that time was the Philistines’ capital city, where Abimelech ruled from. The place in the desert where Abimelech and Abraham made their covenant (Beersheba) was probably located on the border of the Philistines’ territory. Alternate translation: “to the land where the Philistines lived.”

21:34	rc8r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יָמִ֥ים רַבִּֽים	1	Abraham lived in the Philistines’ territory for around 25 years, so keep that in mind as you translate this phrase. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this time phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “… lived there for many years in the land …” Do what is best in your language.
22:1	oi54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י אַחַר֙ הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה	1	This is the beginning of a new episode that takes place around twelve years after Abraham and King Abimelech made their treaty (chapter 21).

Alternate translation: “Sometime after those things happened” or “Several years later”
22:1	y0sj			וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים נִסָּ֖ה אֶת אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like the test was over. Rather it introduces what the following episode is about. Alternate translation: “God wanted to test Abraham.”

22:1	padv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִנֵּֽנִ⁠י	1	Abraham’s reply is respectful and means that he is listening and ready to do what God wants him to do. Consider what is the best way to say this phrase in your language. Alternate translation: “Yes, Master?” or “What is it, Lord”

22:3	kxn0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְבַקַּע֙ עֲצֵ֣י	1	The reason Abraham is the only one mentioned in this clause and in the next sentence is that he is in focus. He did not travel alone and he probably did not chop the wood alone. Decide whether or not you need to make that explicit in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he split some firewood with them” or “and they chopped some firewood together”
22:3	pd14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עֹלָ֔ה	1	Some languages must translate this noun phrase using a verb. Do what is natural in your language. See what you did in verse 2.

24:8	mdi5			מִ⁠שְּׁבֻעָתִ֖⁠י זֹ֑את	1	An oath is a serious, unbreakable promise or vow that is made before God to guarantee that it will be fulfilled. See how you translated the verb form of this word (“swear” or “vow”) in verse 3. Alternate translation: “then you will be released from keeping this oath that I am requesting you to swear now.” or “then you will not have to fulfill this binding promise that you are swearing to me now.”

Also, in that culture, people owned servants and had complete authority over them. Make sure your translation of **master** and **servant** does not imply that the servant was mistreated. Servants were treated well, could hold important positions and were often considered as members of the master’s family. See how you translated a related term “mistress/owner” in Gen 16:4, 8-9.
24:9	ezs1			וַ⁠יִּשָּׁ֣בַֽע ל֔⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated **swore** in verse 7 and “swear” in verse 3. Alternate translation: “and made an vow to him” or “and made an unbreakable promise to him”
24:9	w2zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	Some languages need to make explicit what **this matter** refers to. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “that he would do what he had told him to do.” or “that he would go find a wife for Isaac.”
24:10	l8l3			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֣ח הָ֠⁠עֶבֶד עֲשָׂרָ֨ה גְמַלִּ֜ים מִ⁠גְּמַלֵּ֤י אֲדֹנָי⁠ו֙	1	Make sure that your translation of **took** does not imply that the servant stole the camels or valuable things from Abraham. Rather, the **good things** that he loaded on the camels included things that he would give as gifts to Isaac’s relatives (verse 53). Also, see how you translated **camels** in Gen 12:16.
24:10	zzj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֔לֶךְ וְ⁠כָל ט֥וּב אֲדֹנָ֖י⁠ו בְּ⁠יָד֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּ֗קָם	1	For some languages, it is best to make it explicit here in verse 10 that other servants went with Abraham’s chief servant, rather than have them appear suddenly in verse 32. Do what is best in your language.
24:10	cwi1			וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ אֶל	1	This was about a 800 kilometer (500 mile) trip and would take camels about seventeen days to complete. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “and made the long journey to” or “Then he traveled to”
24:10	pnrb			אֶל עִ֥יר נָחֽוֹר	1	Nahor lived in the city of Haran (Gen 11:31-32). That information could be put in a footnote. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Nahor owned the city.
24:11	csy7			אֶל בְּאֵ֣ר הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	Each town or city had a well where people from the city came to get their water. See how you translated **well of water** in Gen 21:19. You might need to translate this in a slightly different way here because of the different context. Alternate translation: “near its well” or “by the public well that was there”
24:11	qle5			לְ⁠עֵ֣ת עֶ֔רֶב	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
24:11	ct2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠עֵ֖ת צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֹּׁאֲבֹֽת	1	In that time and culture, there was no running water in homes so people had to come out to the city well to get water for their families. Alternate translation: “the time when the young women of the city came out to draw water from the well for their families” or “when the young women of the city were starting to come out to the well to get water for their families”

24:12	cv0l			הַקְרֵה נָ֥א לְ⁠פָנַ֖⁠י הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	 Alternate translation: “please help me do what I have come here to do today”

24:13	fd2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י נִצָּ֖ב עַל	1	Make sure in your translation that what Abraham’s servant says here to Yahweh sounds polite and respectful, not rude, demanding, or complaining. Also, he is not telling God something that God did not already know. Alternate translation: “Look here I am, standing near” or “As you know, I am standing here beside”
24:13	ulm2			עֵ֣ין הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	The phrase **spring of water** (here and in verse 16) refers to the same well that is referred to in verses 11 and 20, which means that this was probably a spring-fed well. Some translation teams use only one term to refer to this spring or well throughout this chapter in order to prevent confusion. Decide what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “this spring-fed well,”
24:13	awnn			וּ⁠בְנוֹת֙ אַנְשֵׁ֣י הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	 Alternate translation: “and the daughters of the townspeople” or “and the young women of the city”

24:14	w6tq			הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֗ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֹמַ֤ר אֵלֶ֨י⁠הָ֙	1	The phrase **young woman** is actually a single word in Hebrew (like the old English words “damsel” and “maiden”) and refers to a young woman who is old enough to get married, but has never been married before. Some languages have a single word for this; other languages prefer a phrase.
24:14	qkdm			הַטִּי נָ֤א כַדֵּ⁠ךְ֙	1	The water containers that people used were usually made out of clay. Alternate translation: “Please lower your water jug”
24:14	avo0			וְ⁠אֶשְׁתֶּ֔ה	1	 Alternate translation: “so that I can drink some water,” or “so that I can take a drink of water,”
24:14	mgn6			וְ⁠אָמְרָ֣ה	1	 Alternate translation: “if she says to me,”
24:14	ych4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	שְׁתֵ֔ה וְ⁠גַם גְּמַלֶּ֖י⁠ךָ אַשְׁקֶ֑ה	1	For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make one or both of the two embedded direct quotes in this verse into indirect quotes. For example you could say, “Please make it happen that when I ask one of the young women to lower her jug so that I can have a drink of water, she will offer me a drink and will also offer to draw water for my camels.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Have a drink, and I will also get water for your camels”

24:15	b9n9			וַֽ⁠יְהִי ה֗וּא טֶרֶם֮ כִּלָּ֣ה לְ⁠דַבֵּר֒	1	Many translations omit the phrase **Then it happened**, but this phrase emphasizes the events that follow it and adds suspense, so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Do what is natural in your language.
24:15	e70q			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֧ה	1	This phrase spotlights Rebekah and shows that she is the center of attention. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: “just then he saw” or “suddenly he saw”
24:15	h8p0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	רִבְקָ֣ה יֹצֵ֗את	1	Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce Rebekah here for the first time in this episode. Some translations use an exclamation point to help show the excitement.
24:15	mbyu			אֲשֶׁ֤ר יֻלְּדָה֙ לִ⁠בְתוּאֵ֣ל	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Her father was Bethuel,”
24:15	fygo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠כַדָּ֖⁠הּ עַל שִׁכְמָֽ⁠הּ	1	For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “Rebekah was coming out of the city with/carrying her/a water jar/jug on her shoulder.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “She was carrying a water jug on her shoulder.” or “She had a water jug on her shoulder.”
24:16	zld1			וְ⁠הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֗ טֹבַ֤ת מַרְאֶה֙ מְאֹ֔ד בְּתוּלָ֕ה	1	See how you translated **young woman** in verses 14 and 15. Alternate translation: “Rebekah was a very beautiful unmarried young woman,”

24:16	q92s			וַ⁠תֵּ֣רֶד	1	Notice that the spring or well was at a place that was lower than the place where Abraham’s servant was standing. Alternate translation: “She went down”
24:16	x0t1			הָ⁠עַ֔יְנָ⁠ה	1	See how you translated **spring** in verse 13. Alternate translation: “to the spring-fed well,”
24:16	vgr9			וַ⁠תְּמַלֵּ֥א כַדָּ֖⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “filled her jar with water,”
24:16	vj4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תָּֽעַל	1	If it is not clear, you may need to make it explicit in your translation that Rebekah still had the jar with her when she came up from the well or spring, especially since she lowers it from her shoulder in verse 18. Alternate translation: “and came back up with it on her shoulder.”
24:17	vyeh			וַ⁠יָּ֥רָץ הָ⁠עֶ֖בֶד לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֑⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “Then the servant ran up to her”

24:18	x3u8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics	שְׁתֵ֣ה אֲדֹנִ֑⁠י	1	Make sure that Rebekah’s reply is polite and respectful in your language, though the way she addresses Abraham’s servant should not make it sound like she is his slave. Also see how you translated **my lord** in Gen 23:6, 11, 15. Alternate translation: “Certainly, sir, you may have a drink.”
24:18	o34c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תְּמַהֵ֗ר וַ⁠תֹּ֧רֶד כַּדָּ֛⁠הּ עַל יָדָ֖⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “Then she quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder to her hands”

24:20	llu6			וַ⁠תְּמַהֵ֗ר וַ⁠תְּעַ֤ר כַּדָּ⁠הּ֙	1	See how you translated **Then she hurried and** in verse 18. Alternate translation: “So she quickly poured the rest of the water from her jug”
24:20	xlk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶל הַ⁠שֹּׁ֔קֶת	1	The drinking trough was a long, open stone container that several animals could drink from at the same time. Alternate translation: “into the animal drinking place that was there” or “into the stone thing that was there for animals to drink out of”
24:20	brw2			וַ⁠תָּ֥רָץ ע֛וֹד אֶֽל הַ⁠בְּאֵ֖ר לִ⁠שְׁאֹ֑ב	1	 Alternate translation: “and ran back and forth to the well to get more water,”
24:20	zyv5			וַ⁠תִּשְׁאַ֖ב לְ⁠כָל גְּמַלָּֽי⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “until she had brought enough for all of the camels.”
24:21	qhyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וְ⁠הָ⁠אִ֥ישׁ מִשְׁתָּאֵ֖ה לָ֑⁠הּ מַחֲרִ֕ישׁ	1	Starting in verse 21 the Hebrew text takes Rebekah and Laban’s perspective and refers to Abraham’s servant as **the man**. This continues until verse 34, when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham’s servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as “Abraham’s servant” or “the servant” throughout this chapter.
24:21	mzx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לָ⁠דַ֗עַת הַֽ⁠הִצְלִ֧יחַ יְהוָ֛ה דַּרְכּ֖⁠וֹ אִם לֹֽא	1	 Alternate translation: “to find out whether or not Yahweh had made him successful on his trip to find a wife for Isaac.” or “to see for sure if Yahweh had given him success on his trip.”
24:22	z0mg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֨ר כִּלּ֤וּ הַ⁠גְּמַלִּים֙ לִ⁠שְׁתּ֔וֹת	1	 Alternate translation: “After all the camels had drunk as much water as they wanted and Rebekah had stopped drawing water,”

Other teams do the opposite. One beka was about 1/5 of an ounce (5.5 grams), and ten shekels (See below) was about 4 ounces (110 grams). Alternate translation: “the servant brought out a gold nose ring weighing one beka and gave it to her” or “the servant gave her a gold nose ring that weighed one beka”
24:22	szjk			וּ⁠שְׁנֵ֤י צְמִידִים֙ & זָהָ֖ב	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He also gave her two gold bracelets”
24:22	afe9			עַל יָדֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	The Hebrew term is ambiguous here; it can refer to hands, arms, or wrists. However in this context, the bracelets would have been put on the arms or the wrists.
24:22	pn2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	עֲשָׂרָ֥ה & מִשְׁקָלָֽ⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “Each bracelet weighed ten shekels.”
24:23	ivak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	 Alternate translation: “Then he said to her” or “Then he asked Rebekah,”
24:23	m6vp			בַּת מִ֣י אַ֔תְּ הַגִּ֥ידִי נָ֖א לִ֑⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The phrase **Please tell me** can go: (1) with the previous question (“Whose daughter are you?”); or (2) with the following question (“Is there a place...to lodge?”).  Since Abraham’s servant’s goal was to find a wife for Isaac who was one of Abraham’s relatives, the first interpretation seems most likely.
24:23	t1yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֲ⁠יֵ֧שׁ בֵּית אָבִ֛י⁠ךְ מָק֥וֹם	1	If you made **your father** explicit in the previous sentence, it may be more natural to refer to him with the pronoun “his” in this sentence. Alternate translation: “Also, is there enough room in his house” or “Also, does your father have any room in his house”
24:23	pzbr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֖⁠נוּ	1	The pronoun **us** includes other servants who came with Abraham’s chief servant (as verse 32 shows). If your language has inclusive and exclusive forms of this pronoun, you should use the exclusive form here.
24:23	zoch			לָ⁠לִֽין	1	 Alternate translation: “to stay there tonight?”
24:24	edbe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “She answered him,” or “She replied,”
24:24	v7bk			בַּת בְּתוּאֵ֖ל אָנֹ֑כִי	1	 Alternate translation: “Bethuel is my father,”
24:24	l5rk			בֶּן מִלְכָּ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלְדָ֖ה לְ⁠נָחֽוֹר	1	Make sure the way you translate this does not sound like Bethuel was the only son of Milcah and Nahor; they had eight sons (Gen 22: 21-22). Also, in some cultures the father’s name is normally given first; in other cultures the mother’s name is normally first. Alternate translation: “who is a son of Milcah and Nahor.” or “and his parents are Nahor and Milcah.”
24:25	pbeh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	Some languages leave this quote margin implied here, because the same person is still talking to the same person. Other languages can keep the quote margin (like the Hebrew text does), to emphasize what Rebekah says next. The quote margin may also indicate that Rebekah paused before she said what she says in verse 25. Alternate translation: “Then she continued,”
24:25	wijh			גַּם תֶּ֥בֶן גַּם מִסְפּ֖וֹא רַ֣ב עִמָּ֑⁠נוּ	1	The term **fodder** refers to dry feed that is prepared for animals to eat; it can include chopped hay and grains such as oats and barley. Alternate translation: “We have plenty of both straw and other feed at our house for your camels to eat,”
24:25	dj14			גַּם מָק֖וֹם	1	 Alternate translation: “and there is also enough room in his house for all of you”
24:25	c715			לָ⁠לֽוּן	1	See how you translated this in verse 23. Alternate translation: “to spend the night there.”

The word **prostrated** means he bowed low to the ground and touched his face or forehead to the ground with outstretched arms, in an act of worship. When combined with **bowed down** as in this verse, it is usually translated as “worshiped”.
24:27	kzzy			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	The servant is worshiping God by bowing down and by what he says in verse 27. Alternate translation: “He said,”
24:27	lmcg			בָּר֤וּךְ יְהוָה֙	1	See how you translated this in Gen 9:26. Alternate translation: “I praise Yahweh,”
24:27	w2ii			אֱלֹהֵי֙ אֲדֹנִ֣⁠י אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	See how you translated **God of my master Abraham** in verse 12. Alternate translation: “who is the God whom my master Abraham worships”

See how you translated **kindness** in verses 12 and 14. The phrase **not abandoned** is a way of emphasizing that Yahweh had always been kind and faithful to Abraham. Alternate translation: “He has always been kind and faithful to my master,”
24:27	inzl			אָנֹכִ֗י בַּ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ נָחַ֣⁠נִי יְהוָ֔ה	1	The last part of verse 27 is what Abraham’s servant is praising God for; it is an example of how God has been kind and faithful to Abraham. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “and he has guided me on the road here” or “Yes, he guided me on my trip here”
24:28	easg			וַ⁠תָּ֨רָץ֙ הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֔	1	See how you translated **young woman** previously in this chapter, and consider what is the best way to refer to Rebekah here. Alternate translation: “Then Rebekah ran home”
24:28	tpgz			וַ⁠תַּגֵּ֖ד	1	 Alternate translation: “and reported to” or “and shared the news with”
24:28	fyzw			כַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֖ים הָ⁠אֵֽלֶּה	1	 Alternate translation: “about what the man had said to her.”
24:29	w36y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וּ⁠לְ⁠רִבְקָ֥ה אָ֖ח	1	Laban was Rebekah’s older brother. Some languages have a specific term for “older brother” that fits well here. Also, consider what is the best way to introduce this background information in your language. Alternate translation: “Now it so happened that Rebekah had a brother”
24:29	fm49			וּ⁠שְׁמ֣⁠וֹ לָבָ֑ן	1	 Alternate translation: “named Laban,”
24:29	natm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יָּ֨רָץ לָבָ֧ן	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also consider what is the best way to refer to Laban here in your language. Alternate translation: “and he ran” or “He ran”
24:29	awi9			אֶל הָ⁠אִ֛ישׁ הַ⁠ח֖וּצָ⁠ה אֶל הָ⁠עָֽיִן	1	 Alternate translation: “out to the spring where the man was.” or “to where the man was standing beside the well.”
24:30	isaz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י כִּ⁠רְאֹ֣ת	1	Verse 30 is a flashback of what had happened before Laban ran to the well (verse 29). Consider what is the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine verses 29-30 and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, “Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets she was wearing and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well.” If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29-30. Alternate translation: “This is how it was When he had seen” or “As soon as he had seen”
24:30	ez7q			אֶת הַ⁠נֶּ֗זֶם וְֽ⁠אֶת הַ⁠צְּמִדִים֮ עַל יְדֵ֣י אֲחֹת⁠וֹ֒	1	Some languages have a specific term for “younger sister” that fits well here.

25:8	uf1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יֵּאָ֖סֶף אֶל	1	The phrase **gathered to his people** is a euphemism that refers to dying but also implies that God took his spirit to be with his ancestors who had already died. It is best to translate this phrase fairly literally since it teaches about life after death. Alternate translation: “he was taken by God to be with” or “God took his spirit to be with”
25:8	z547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַמָּֽי⁠ו	1	Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like these ancestors were still alive. They had already died before Abraham died.

25:10	ekpo			מֵ⁠אֵ֣ת בְּנֵי חֵ֑ת	1	The Hebrew text has two different ways to refer to the Hittites; compare the phrase here with verse 9 where a single Hebrew word is used to refer to this people group. See how you translated **the sons of Heth** in Gen 23:20.
25:10	l4kk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שָׁ֛מָּ⁠ה קֻבַּ֥ר אַבְרָהָ֖ם וְ⁠שָׂרָ֥ה אִשְׁתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Abraham had already buried Sarah’s body in the cave (Gen 23:19).

Both refer to temporary or permanent places where people settled, surrounded by some sort of wall or fence. Also, many translations have “princes” here instead of “rulers,” but these Ishmaelite rulers were not actually sons of a king. See how you translated **rulers** in Gen 17:20. Alternate translation: “who became the rulers of twelve tribes that were named after them, and each tribe lived in its own settlements and camps” or “Each of them became the ruler of a tribe that was named after him, and each tribe had its own villages and tent settlements.”

The name **Shur** means “wall”. The Wilderness of Shur may have been named after a city or fortification named Shur that was located near the eastern border of Egypt (Gen 16:7). Alternate translation: “throughout the area that extended from the region of Havilah to the desert of Shur”
25:18	c8ld			אֲשֶׁר֙ עַל פְּנֵ֣י מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	 Alternate translation: “that is east of the land of Egypt”

It could mean: (1) “He/They lived in hostility toward/against all his/their brothers/relatives.” or “They lived as enemies against all their brothers/relatives.” See how you translated a different idiom in 16:12 that probably has this meaning. Or it could mean: (2) “They settled/lived in the presence of all their brothers/relatives.” or “They settled/lived among/near all their brothers/relatives.” or (3) “He/Ishmael died in the presence of all his brothers/relatives.” or “He/Ishmael died when/while all his brothers were still alive.”

See how you translated **barren** in Gen 11:30. Also, it may be clearer to change the order of the clauses in this sentence to put them in the order in which they happened. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Isaac prayed earnestly to Yahweh for his wife to have children because she was barren” or “But for many years Rebekah was not able to get pregnant, so Isaac prayed that Yahweh would give her children.”

28:9	vycn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֲח֧וֹת נְבָי֛וֹת	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Nebaioth** in Gen 25:13.

28:10	ctw0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חָרָֽנָ⁠ה	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob was heading toward the same place that his father had told him to go to in verse 2.

Rather the focus is on the period of time between now when God is speaking to Jacob and the time later on when Jacob would see the fulfillment of God’s promises to him.

Alternate translation: “Then he poured some olive oil on top of the pillar to dedicate the place to God.”

Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “God, if you will be with me”
28:20	lyjc			וּ⁠שְׁמָרַ֨⁠נִי֙	1	See how you translated **watch over** in verse 15. Alternate translation: “and guard me” or “and take care of me”

29:7	xi00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הַשְׁק֥וּ הַ⁠צֹּ֖אן	1	For some languages it sounds too rude for Jacob to make a direct command here, so it is better to make this a suggestion or even a rhetorical question. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “You ought to get water for them” or “It seems like you should water your sheep” or “So why not water your sheep”

This rhetorical question expects the implied answer “No, of course not!” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a statement here instead. Alternate translation: “Just because you are my nephew, does that mean that you should work for me without pay?” or “Even though you are my relative that does not mean that you should have to work for me for free!” or “You should not have to work for me for nothing just because you are my nephew!”

29:17	chl6			וְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י לֵאָ֖ה רַכּ֑וֹת	1	The Hebrew word for **delicate** is ambiguous in this context. It can have: (1) a positive meaning of “pretty” or **lovely** or (2) a negative meaning of “weak”, which implies that Leah’s eyes were plain, dull, or unattractive.

Do what is most clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: “but to him it seemed like only a few days had passed because he loved her so much.” or “but he loved her so much that to him the years seemed to pass quickly like only a few days.”

Also make sure that Jacob’s request here sounds polite in your translation, not rude or demanding. It should also not sound like he was begging or pleading. Alternate translation: “Please let me marry your daughter Rachel now so that I can live with her as my wife, because I have finished my seven years of service for you.” or “I have fulfilled the seven years of service that we agreed on, so please let me have your daughter Rachel so that I can marry her and live with her.”

See how you translated the euphemism **went to** in Gen 16:4 (and “go to” in Gen 16:2 and 29:21). Translate this in a way that is natural, clear, and acceptable for reading in public. Alternate translation: “so that he had sexual relations with Leah.” or “so he slept with Leah.” or “spent the night with her”
29:24	zehs			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֤ן לָבָן֙	1	It is not clear in the Hebrew text when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah, so it is probably best to keep it that way in your translation. Some translations say that Laban “had already given” Zilpah to Leah before the wedding night. However according to Jewish history (outside the Bible), it was on the wedding night that Laban did this as part of his plan to deceive Jacob: Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, so everyone would expect her to be given to Rachel as the younger sister; seeing Zilpah (instead of Bilhah) would help Jacob think that his veiled bride was Rachel. Since we do not know for sure which interpretation is right, it is probably best to be like the Hebrew text and not specify when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah. Some translations put this verse in parentheses because it seems to interrupt the telling of the main events. Alternate translation: “In addition, Laban gave”

Also, make sure that your translation of **she** refers here to Leah, not Zilpah (who was mentioned in verse 24). Alternate translation: “Jacob saw that his new wife was Leah!” or “Jacob was shocked to discover that it was Leah he had married!”
29:25	qd1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל לָבָ֗ן	1	Some languages use an honorific title such as “his father-in-law” here now that Jacob is married.

For example, you could say, “Our custom/practice here is to wait until the firstborn/oldest daughter is married before we let the younger daughters/ones get married.” Do what is best in your language.

29:27	w292			וְ⁠נִתְּנָ֨ה לְ⁠ךָ֜ גַּם אֶת זֹ֗את	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Then our family will also give you my other daughter to marry” or “Then you may also marry my other daughter”

30:6	pbso		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֤אמֶר רָחֵל֙	1	Consider whether it is more natural here in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the sentence from verse 5. Alternate translation: “Then Rachel said”
30:6	uc2m			דָּנַ֣⁠נִּי אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Some translations have “judged me” here. However, make sure your translation of this phrase has a positive meaning (making a decision in Rachel’s favor) and not a negative meaning (condemning her).

30:6	fc14			עַל כֵּ֛ן	1	 Alternate translation: “Because of that”
30:6	kpso			קָרְאָ֥ה שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	Make sure it is clear here in your translation that Bilhah’s son is the one being named, not God (who was the subject of the previous sentence). See how you translated **called his name** in Gen 29:32. Alternate translation: “she called him” or “she gave him the name” or “she named her baby”

30:8	fope			נַפְתּוּלֵ֨י אֱלֹהִ֧ים נִפְתַּ֛לְתִּי עִם אֲחֹתִ֖⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “I have had a mighty/difficult struggle/contest with my sister” or “I have struggled intensely/hard with/against my sister”. That would be the meaning if the Hebrew word “elohim” in this phrase is used as an adjective that means “mighty/powerful.” (2) “I have wrestled/struggled with God because of my sister”, which could refer to a struggle against her sister praying to God for children. That would be the meaning if the word “elohim” in this phrase means “God.”

30:13	jwvp			בְּ⁠אָשְׁרִ֕⁠י	1	Although many translations have “happy” in this verse instead of “blessed,” the Hebrew noun (and the verb it is based on) is more general and has to do with a person’s blessed state (which results in joy and happiness). The same Hebrew word is used in Psalm 1:1, and the equivalent Greek word is used in Luke 1:48 and Matthew 5:3-11. Alternate translation: “I am truly blessed!” or “God has greatly blessed me!”
30:13	d2t9			כִּ֥י אִשְּׁר֖וּ⁠נִי בָּנ֑וֹת	1	 Alternate translation: “Now other women will say that I am blessed by God.” or “Now other women will say that God has blessed me.”

30:24	ogv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	For some languages it is more natural to put the last half of verse 24 first in the verse and say, “She also said, “May Yahweh add/give another son to me.” So she named that/her son Joseph, which means “may he add/give another.”” Do what is best in your language.
30:24	vyef			יֹסֵ֧ף יְהוָ֛ה לִ֖⁠י בֵּ֥ן אַחֵֽר	1	 Alternate translation: “I ask that Yahweh will give me another son.” or “I ask Yahweh to give me another son.”

30:25	r0t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	שַׁלְּחֵ֨⁠נִי֙	1	Make sure that your translation of Jacob’s request here sounds polite, not rude or disrespectful. It should also not sound like he is begging or pleading. See how you translated the same request in Gen 24:54. Alternate translation: “Please send me on my way,”

30:27	hsr3			נִחַ֕שְׁתִּי	1	The word **divination** refers to trying to find out information by looking at signs (omens) and interpreting them either by God’s power (Gen 44:5, 15) or by witchcraft and false gods (Ezekiel 21:21). Laban may have consulted his household gods (mentioned in Gen 31:19, 30). It could also be that Laban meant that he had figured this out simply by observing how God had blessed him through Jacob’s expert tending of his flocks. Alternate translation: “because I have learned from experience”

30:28	b7cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	Some translations delete this quote margin, since the same person is still speaking to the same person as in the previous verse. However it could be that there was a pause in the conversation, or the author may want to show that there is a change in topic or emphasize what is said next. So if possible, it is best to keep the quote margin here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Then he said to him,” or “Then Laban added,”

30:32	sir5			כָּל שֶׂ֣ה נָקֹ֣ד וְ⁠טָל֗וּא וְ⁠כָל שֶׂה חוּם֙ בַּ⁠כְּשָׂבִ֔ים	1	The Hebrew word for **speckled** refers to small spots, whereas **spotted** refers to medium-sized and bigger spots. In that part of the world, most sheep were white and most goats were solid brown or black. So Jacob was asking for the irregular animals for himself, including white sheep with dark marks, dark-colored goats with light marks and dark-colored lambs. You could put some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “all the lambs that have speckles or spots, or that are dark-colored,”

Some languages cannot personify righteousness like that. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Also, in the future you will know whether or not I am being honest” or “That way too, in the future it will be easy for everyone to know whether or not I am being honest”
30:33	ppfp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי תָב֥וֹא עַל שְׂכָרִ֖⁠י לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	For some languages it is more natural to move this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “Also, in the future, whenever you check the animals you have paid/given me, you will know whether or not I am being honest.” Do what is best in your own language. Alternate translation: “whenever you check the animals you have given me.”

They were small enough to be used in a private home. In this chapter these statues are referred to as **idols** (in verses 19, 34, 35 when the author refers to them) and “gods” (in quotes in verses 30 and 32 when Laban or Jacob talk about them). If it is confusing in your language to switch back and forth between these two terms, you could use “gods” throughout this chapter, since Laban would not have called them idols, and Jacob would not have used that term in his presence. However, if possible, it is best to translate the two terms the way the Hebrew text has them. Alternate translation: “his family gods,” or “the gods that he had”

Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Jacob left a second time. To make this clear you could say, “After Jacob and his family ran away with everything that they owned, they quickly crossed the Euphrates River and headed toward the hill country of Gilead.” Alternate translation: “So Jacob and his family ran away”

It could mean: (1) “the One/God whom Isaac fears/reveres” or (2) “Isaac’s God whom people/others are afraid/terrified of”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is only talking about one God in this verse, not two or three. Also notice that **my father** and **Isaac** both refer to Jacob’s father Isaac, not two different people. Alternate translation: “If God, the Awesome One, whom my father Isaac and grandfather Abraham serve” or “If God, whom my ancestors Abraham and Isaac serve and fear”

31:43	l7ol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠כֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר אַתָּ֥ה רֹאֶ֖ה לִ⁠י	1	Laban is lying or exaggerating here to make it sound like he was wronged, when actually he is the one who was dishonest in his dealings with Jacob. Alternate translation: “In fact, everything that you see here is mine!” or “Yes, everything that is here with you is actually mine!”
31:43	p48f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לִ⁠בְנֹתַ֞⁠י מָֽה־אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֤ה לָ⁠אֵ֨לֶּה֙ הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם א֥וֹ לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ן אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלָֽדוּ	1	Laban uses this rhetorical question to express his emotions and emphasize that there is nothing that he can do.

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated **So now** in verse 16 and **cut a covenant** in Gen 26:28. Alternate translation: “So then, you and I should make a peace covenant with each other,” or “So I invite you to make a covenant with me,”
31:44	e2ml			וְ⁠הָיָ֥ה	1	The subject of the Hebrew verb in this phrase is masculine singular, so it cannot refer to “covenant,” which is feminine singular. It is probably best to translate this phrase in a general way. Alternate translation: “and let there be”
31:44	hw1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לְ⁠עֵ֖ד בֵּינִ֥⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	If your language has a dual pronoun for **us**, you could use it in this verse.

31:46	d3ho			וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֤ב לְ⁠אֶחָי⁠ו֙	1	These relatives would have included Jacob’s sons, as well as Laban and his men who had come with him. See how you translated **relatives** in verses 23, 25, 32, 37. Alternate translation: “Then Jacob told his relatives,”

Alternate translation: “which I helped set up between us to remind us to keep our peace treaty.” or “which we set up between us to remind us about our peace covenant”

31:53	kg7k			וֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵ֤י נָחוֹר֙ & אֱלֹהֵ֖י אֲבִי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Abraham trusted in Yahweh, the one and only true God (Gen 15:6). Terah worshiped other gods (Joshua 24:2), and so did Laban (verses 19, 30), which suggests that Nahor served the same gods that his father Terah served, and then taught his son Laban to do the same thing. In spite of that, many translations still capitalize **God** all three times here in verse 53. Be consistent with how you spelled **Nahor** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 11:22-25, 29; 12:26-27; 22:20, 24, 28; 24:9, 15, 24, 47; 29:5; 31:53. Alternate translation: “and the gods that my grandfather Nahor and his father Terah worshiped”

See how you translated **swore** in Gen 26:31, and compare that to how you translated a related phrase (“vowed a vow”) in 31:13. Alternate translation: “But Jacob swore” or “But Jacob vowed a vow”
31:53	jtf2			בְּ⁠פַ֖חַד אָבִ֥י⁠ו יִצְחָֽק	1	See how you translated “the Fear of Isaac” in verse 42. Alternate translation: “by the God whom his father Isaac feared that he would keep their treaty,” or “with the Fear of his father Isaac as his witness”
31:54	j4i6			וַ⁠יִּזְבַּ֨ח יַעֲקֹ֥ב זֶ֨בַח֙ בָּ⁠הָ֔ר	1	Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob burned the animal while it was still alive. Also see how you translated **sacrificed** in Gen 22:13. Alternate translation: “and he offered an animal sacrifice to God on an altar on a hill.” or “and Jacob burned the body of an animal on an altar as a sacrifice to God on a hill.”
31:54	xzn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א לְ⁠אֶחָ֖י⁠ו לֶ⁠אֱכָל לָ֑חֶם	1	In the Bible, **bread** is often used as an idiom that refers to food in general. In this context, it was a meal that they shared together. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
31:54	lc58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אכְלוּ לֶ֔חֶם וַ⁠יָּלִ֖ינוּ בָּ⁠הָֽר	1	As in Genesis 26:30, eating together was an important part of the covenant or treaty process, since it shows unity and close relationship, as if they were part of the same family. Some of that information could be included in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Then after they had eaten the meal, they spent the night there on the hill.”
31:55	m83j			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם לָבָ֜ן בַּ⁠בֹּ֗קֶר	1	See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 28:18. Alternate translation: “The next morning Laban got up early”
31:55	t8nb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְנַשֵּׁ֧ק לְ⁠בָנָ֛י⁠ו וְ⁠לִ⁠בְנוֹתָ֖י⁠ו	1	It was a Hebrew custom for relatives and close friends to greet each other with a kiss on each cheek. Only make this information explicit here if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning. Alternate translation: “said goodbye to his daughters and grandchildren and kissed them on the cheeks”
31:55	v5ei			וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ וַ⁠יָּ֥שָׁב לָבָ֖ן לִ⁠מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Laban and his men left from there and returned home.” or “Then he left from there with his men and went back home.”

32:1	jfda			וַ⁠יִּפְגְּעוּ ב֖⁠וֹ מַלְאֲכֵ֥י אֱלֹהִֽים	1	Translate **met** in a way that allows for the fact that no conversation is recorded between the angels and Jacob and that the angels were probably not hostile; for example, they may have been sent by God to escort and protect him. Alternate translation: “and some angels from God encountered him.”
32:2	a5gq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָאָ֔⁠ם	1	Make sure that you refer to Jacob and the angels here in a way that is accurate and natural in your language. Alternate translation: “When Jacob saw the angels, he said in surprise,”
32:2	gvw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֛א שֵֽׁם הַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא מַֽחֲנָֽיִם	1	If you include the meaning of the name **Mahanaim** in your translation or in a footnote, be sure it matches the way you translated **God’s camp** earlier in the verse so that it is clear why Jacob gave the place that name. Also see how you translated **he called the name of that place** in Gen 28:19.
32:3	egca			וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֨ח יַעֲקֹ֤ב מַלְאָכִים֙ לְ⁠פָנָ֔י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Jacob sent some of his servants ahead of him to deliver a message to his brother Esau”

Do this in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I want you to tell Esau whom I highly respect:”
32:4	iepc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֤ה אָמַר֙ עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	Verses 4 and 5 have two levels of embedded quotes. Some languages need to use indirect quotes for one or both of those levels; for example, “Your servant Jacob wants you to know that he has been sojourning/staying with your uncle Laban all this time.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “This is a message from Jacob who wants to serve you:”
32:4	qibe			עִם לָבָ֣ן גַּ֔רְתִּי וָ⁠אֵחַ֖ר עַד עָֽתָּה	1	 Alternate translation: “Since we last saw each other, I have been living with Uncle Laban.”

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “I will cause things to prosper with you” in verse 9 and how you translated **as the sand** in Gen 22:17. Alternate translation: “that you would surely prosper me, and that you would make my descendants as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore,”
32:12	jpv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא יִסָּפֵ֖ר מֵ⁠רֹֽב	1	 Alternate translation: “which cannot be counted because there are so many.” or “which are so many that no one can count them all.”

See how you translated **she-goats**, **he-goats**, **ewes** and **rams** in Gen 31:10. Alternate translation: “including 200 nanny goats and twenty billy goats, 200 female sheep and twenty male sheep,” or “including 200 nanny goats, twenty billy goats, 200 female sheep, twenty male sheep,”

32:20	s0ro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲכַפְּרָ֣ה פָנָ֗י⁠ו בַּ⁠מִּנְחָה֙	1	The idiom **cover his face** means to try to calm someone’s anger by doing something to please him. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom you could use here. Alternate translation: “I can pacify Esau by sending” or “Perhaps Esau will stop being angry at me if I send”
32:20	ne75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בַּ⁠מִּנְחָה֙ הַ⁠הֹלֶ֣כֶת לְ⁠פָנָ֔⁠י	1	For some languages it is more natural to use an indirect quote here and say, “because he thought that if he sent the gifts of animals ahead of himself to Esau, then Esau would stop being angry at him.” Notice that this alternate translation also changes the clause order. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “him this gift of animals ahead of me” or “this gift of animals to him ahead of me”
32:20	vaa1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי כֵן֙ אֶרְאֶ֣ה פָנָ֔י⁠ו אוּלַ֖י יִשָּׂ֥א פָנָֽ⁠י	1	Make sure that the way you translate this clause fits with how you translated the previous clauses as either a direct or indirect quote. Alternate translation: “After that, perhaps he will forgive me and welcome me when we see each other face to face.”
32:21	r0gm			וַ⁠תַּעֲבֹ֥ר הַ⁠מִּנְחָ֖ה עַל פָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	See how you translated **gift** in verses 13, 18, 20. Alternate translation: “So the animal gifts for Esau were taken ahead of Jacob by his servants,”
32:21	bq6f			וְ⁠ה֛וּא לָ֥ן בַּ⁠לַּֽיְלָה הַ⁠ה֖וּא בַּֽ⁠מַּחֲנֶֽה	1	 Alternate translation: “but Jacob and his family stayed behind at the camp that night.” or “but Jacob himself slept for part of the night in the camp.”
32:22	kfyv			וַ⁠יָּ֣קָם בַּ⁠לַּ֣יְלָה ה֗וּא	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that this is the same night that was referred to in verse 21. Also, the phrase **got up** often refers to initiating an action, but here it may also imply that Jacob got up out of bed after sleeping for a while. Alternate translation: “Later that same night Jacob woke up and took” or “Sometime during that night”
32:22	fc8d			אֶת שְׁתֵּ֤י נָשָׁי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠אֶת שְׁתֵּ֣י שִׁפְחֹתָ֔י⁠ו וְ⁠אֶת אַחַ֥ד עָשָׂ֖ר יְלָדָ֑י⁠ו	1	Consider what is the best way in your language to list these people. See what you did for a similar list of people in Gen 7:13. Alternate translation: “his two wives, two concubines and eleven sons”
32:22	b3kt			וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֔ר	1	 Alternate translation: “and walked across”
32:22	e2wn			אֵ֖ת מַעֲבַ֥ר יַבֹּֽק	1	A ford is a very shallow place in a stream that is fairly easy and safe for people and animals to walk across. The Jabbok Stream was a small river that flowed from east to west into the Jordan River about halfway between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Jacob took his wives and children from the north side of the stream to the south side; his brother was coming towards them from further south. It might be helpful to include a map here in your translation that includes the places named in this chapter and shows where Jacob and Esau were coming from. Alternate translation: “a shallow place on the Jabbok River.” or “a place in the Jabbok Stream that was shallow.”
32:23	xi98			וַ⁠יִּקָּחֵ֔⁠ם וַ⁠יַּֽעֲבִרֵ֖⁠ם אֶת הַ⁠נָּ֑חַל	1	Verse 23 refers back to what already happened in verse 22. Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob’s wives and children crossed the Jabbok Stream twice in verses 22-23. Alternate translation: “After he had taken them across the river,” or “After he did that,”
32:23	p97f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֵ֖ר אֶת אֲשֶׁר ל⁠וֹ	1	At some point, Jacob went back to the north side of the Jabbok Stream, while his family waited for him on the south side. His belongings included the animals that he had not sent ahead to Esau as well as all his other possessions. Alternate translation: “he went back and had his servants take everything that he owned across the river too.” or “he went back and had his servants take all his livestock and other possessions across the river too.”
32:24	vh2l			וַ⁠יִּוָּתֵ֥ר יַעֲקֹ֖ב לְ⁠בַדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “After that, Jacob was alone there for a while,”
32:24	fwnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics	וַ⁠יֵּאָבֵ֥ק אִישׁ֙ עִמּ֔⁠וֹ	1	At some point, Jacob realized that this man was Yahweh in the form of a man (verse 30), so translation teams that capitalize references to God will capitalize all the pronouns that refer to him in verses 24-29 and may or may not capitalize “Man” in these verses. See what you did for a similar case when Yahweh appeared as a man to Abraham in Gen 18. Alternate translation: “and then a man came and wrestled with him”
32:24	hyuk			עַ֖ד עֲל֥וֹת הַ⁠שָּֽׁחַר	1	The word **dawn** refers to the time before sunrise when the sky begins to get light. Alternate translation: “until dawn” or “until daylight started to appear.”
32:25	ddzn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֗רְא כִּ֣י לֹ֤א יָכֹל֙ ל֔⁠וֹ	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to in verses 25-29. Alternate translation: “Then the man realized that he could not defeat him so” or “When the man saw that he was not able to defeat him”
32:25	dhow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּגַּ֖ע בְּ⁠כַף יְרֵכ֑⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “he hit him on his hip,”
32:25	ddyo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תֵּ֨קַע֙ כַּף־יֶ֣רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	Consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun phrase or a pronoun here to refer to Jacob’s hip joint. Alternate translation: “so that it was put out of place” or “and his hip joint went out of place”
32:25	mc3x			בְּ⁠הֵֽאָבְק֖⁠וֹ עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “as he fought with the man.” or “as they fought against each other.”

32:26	y2gk			כִּ֥י עָלָ֖ה הַ⁠שָּׁ֑חַר	1	See how you translated “the dawn came up” in verse 24. Alternate translation: “because it is dawn” or “because daylight is beginning to come!”

32:27	as79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “Then the man asked him”
32:27	etk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	מַה שְּׁמֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language. Alternate translation: “Tell me your name.” or “what his name was.”
32:27	xvcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר יַעֲקֹֽב	1	Make sure in your translation that Jacob’s reply sounds respectful. Also consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language.
32:28	twx4			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	 Alternate translation: “Then the man said to Jacob,”
32:28	uf7y			לֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ יֵאָמֵ֥ר עוֹד֙ שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֔	1	The wording here is similar to what God said when he changed Abram’s name to Abraham (Gen 17:5) and Sarai’s name to Sarah (17:15). After that, Abraham and Sarah were no longer called by their previous names. In the case of Jacob, he continues to be referred to by both of his names in this chapter (**Jacob** in verses 29-30, 32; **Israel** in verse 32) and throughout the rest of the Bible, including by God (Gen 46:2). It could be that although God was changing Jacob’s primary name to “Israel,” he was still known by his previous name too. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “You will no longer be named Jacob,”
32:28	qbvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּ֖י אִם יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	If you include the meaning of the name **Israel** in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translate **struggled** in the following clause.
32:28	udk7			כִּֽי שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם אֱלֹהִ֛ים וְ⁠עִם אֲנָשִׁ֖ים	1	The Hebrew word for **struggled** here is more general than the word for “wrestled” in verses 24 and 25. Alternate translation: “because you have struggled against both God and men”
32:28	yhdd			וַ⁠תּוּכָֽל	1	See how you translated **prevailed** in verse 25 and Gen 30:8. It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “and you have overcome.”
32:29	bkfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics	וַ⁠יִּשְׁאַ֣ל יַעֲקֹ֗ב וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Consider again whether or not you have capitalized references to the man in verses 24-29. See the note about this at verse 24. Alternate translation: “Then Jacob asked him”
32:29	cidm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	הַגִּֽידָ⁠ה נָּ֣א שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language. Alternate translation: “What is your name?” or “what his name was.”

32:29	otq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֥⁠מָּה זֶּ֖ה תִּשְׁאַ֣ל	1	This rhetorical question probably means that there was no need for Jacob to ask the man what his name was; he should have known without asking. Consider whether or not it is best to use a rhetorical question here in your language. Alternate translation: “You do not need to ask me”
32:29	gbbo			לִ⁠שְׁמִ֑⁠י	1	 Alternate translation: “to tell you my name!”
32:30	fpdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	רָאִ֤יתִי אֱלֹהִים֙ פָּנִ֣ים אֶל פָּנִ֔ים	1	 Alternate translation: “I saw God in person here,”
32:30	qdf5			וַ⁠תִּנָּצֵ֖ל נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Jacob was amazed that he was still alive because, although there were exceptions (Exodus 33:11; Judges 13:22), normally people could not see God face to face and live (Exodus 33:20). You could put that information in a footnote so that readers understand why Jacob was surprised. Alternate translation: “but yet my life was spared by him!” or “but yet he has allowed me to live!”
32:31	s3cw			וַ⁠יִּֽזְרַֽח ל֣⁠וֹ הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1	 Alternate translation: “The sun shined on Jacob” or “The sun was rising”
32:31	qtbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָבַ֖ר אֶת פְּנוּאֵ֑ל	1	Penuel is another name for the place that is called Peniel in verse 30. That information could be put in a footnote. Or you could use the same spelling in both verses to avoid confusion; **Penuel** is the spelling in the rest of the Old Testament. Alternate translation: “as he left Penuel and returned to his family.”
32:31	kp04			וְ⁠ה֥וּא צֹלֵ֖עַ	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As he walked, he was limping”
32:31	uumw			עַל יְרֵכֽ⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “because his hip joint was injured”
32:32	adyk			עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	 Alternate translation: “even now” or “even in the present”

32:32	hbfm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁר֙ עַל־כַּ֣ף הַ⁠יָּרֵ֔ךְ	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that this is talking about eating meat from an animal, not about cannibalism.

33:1	kz1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב עֵינָ֗י⁠ו וַ⁠יַּרְא֙	1	Make sure your translation of this idiom does not mean that Jacob looked straight up. Rather, he probably looked carefully to the south (the direction that his brother was coming from). Alternate translation: “Then Jacob looked up and saw” or “Then Jacob looked ahead of him and saw”
33:1	ilei			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה עֵשָׂ֣ו בָּ֔א	1	Esau was still a fair distance away, which gave Jacob time to do everything that he does in verses 1-3. Alternate translation: “that Esau was in the distance coming his way,”
33:1	ozjn			וְ⁠עִמּ֕⁠וֹ אַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת אִ֑ישׁ	1	 Alternate translation: “with 400 men!” or “and that he had 400 men with him!”

See how you translated **divided** in Gen 32:7 and “his two maidservants” in Gen 32:22. Alternate translation: “So he quickly put his children into groups with their own mothers, Leah, Rachel and his two servant wives.” or “So he had his children quickly gather with their own mothers, so that Leah, Rachel and his two concubines were each with her own children.”
33:2	iser			וַ⁠יָּ֧שֶׂם אֶת הַ⁠שְּׁפָח֛וֹת וְ⁠אֶת יַלְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ן	1	See how you translated “his two maidservants” in Gen 32:22. Alternate translation: “He put his two servant wives with their children” or “He put the group that had his two servant wives and their children”
33:2	v7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	רִֽאשֹׁנָ֑ה	1	For some languages it is more natural to put phrases like **first** and **after them** at the beginning of their clauses and say, “First in line he put his two servant wives and/with their children. Behind them he put Leah and/with her children, and last of all he put Rachel and/with her son Joseph.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “in front of all the others,”
33:2	uagu			וְ⁠אֶת לֵאָ֤ה וִֽ⁠ילָדֶ֨י⁠הָ֙	1	 Alternate translation: “then he put Leah and her children”

Make sure that the way you translate **fell on his neck** does not imply that Esau accidentally fell. Rather, this is an idiom that means he embraced Jacob warmly, with much emotion. Alternate translation: “and he threw his arms around his shoulders and kissed him,” or “He held Jacob tightly and kissed him on the cheek”
33:4	nnax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וַ⁠יִּבְכּֽוּ	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, some languages have a dual pronoun for **they** that could be used here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and they both cried for joy.” or “Both of them cried because they were so happy to see each other again.”
33:5	xxbt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֣א אֶת עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	See how you translated the idiom “lifted … eyes” in verse 1 and Gen 31:10. It may be necessary to translate this idiom in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “Then Esau looked up”

33:5	mix3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר חָנַ֥ן אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת עַבְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	Jacob uses the phrase **your servant** to be polite and show respect to Esau; he was not actually Esau’s servant. For some languages it is more natural to put the honorific title first in this sentence and say, “Sir, they are the wives and children whom God has graciously given to me.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “whom God has kindly given to me, your servant.” or “whom God has graciously given to me, sir.”

33:9	b7wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	What Esau says is in contrast to what Jacob said, but it may not be necessary to use a conjunction here at all. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Esau said to him,”
33:9	mkk0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יֶשׁ לִ֣⁠י רָ֑ב אָחִ֕⁠י	1	For some languages it is more natural to put the address **my brother** first in this quote. Some languages also have a special term for “younger brother” that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “My brother, I already own enough livestock”
33:9	hmaj			יְהִ֥י לְ⁠ךָ֖ אֲשֶׁר לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	 Alternate translation: “Keep what you own for yourself.” or “so keep your livestock for yourself.”

33:10	tfke			אַל נָא֙	1	In verses 10 and 11, Jacob speaks urgently to Esau, because in that culture if Esau accepts Jacob’s gift, he is committing himself to treat Jacob as a friend. Alternate translation: “No, I beg you.”

However, God had been gracious to Jacob and allowed him to live (Genesis 32:30). In the same way, it was a terrifying thing for Jacob to see Esau who had 400 men with him, but Esau was gracious to him (33:4). See how you translated a different Hebrew word that means “receive” or “welcome” in Gen 32:20. Alternate translation: “I thought you were still angry at me, so I was afraid of seeing you again in person, just as I would be afraid of meeting God in person, but you forgave me and welcomed me!”

33:12	zjf4			וְ⁠אֵלְכָ֖ה לְ⁠נֶגְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	Esau is suggesting that he would accompany or escort Jacob and his family, not that he would go far ahead of them. Alternate translation: “and I will lead you.”

33:13	xg08			וְ⁠הַ⁠צֹּ֥אן וְ⁠הַ⁠בָּקָ֖ר עָל֣וֹת עָלָ֑⁠י	1	See how you translated “flocks and herds” in Gen 12:16. Alternate translation: “and some of my sheep and cattle are nursing their young.”
33:13	gbse			וּ⁠דְפָקוּ⁠ם֙ י֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	 Alternate translation: “If my men drive the livestock too hard in one day,” or “If I force the livestock to go too fast for even one day,”
33:13	c17q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וָ⁠מֵ֖תוּ כָּל הַ⁠צֹּֽאן	1	This phrase especially refers to the sheep and cattle that were nursing, but Jacob is probably using hyperbole here (**all**) to emphasize that he does not want to travel too fast. Alternate translation: “then all the flocks and herds will die.” or “then all of them will die.”
33:14	g9ie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics	יַעֲבָר נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated Jacob’s use of **my lord** (in verse 8) and **servant** (in verse 5) to show respect and deference to Esau. Here he uses both terms for emphasis.
33:14	qgdi			וַ⁠אֲנִ֞י אֶֽתְנָהֲלָ֣ה לְ⁠אִטִּ֗⁠י לְ⁠רֶ֨גֶל הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר לְ⁠פָנַ⁠י֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠רֶ֣גֶל הַ⁠יְלָדִ֔ים	1	 Alternate translation: “Then I will travel along slowly at a speed that is good for the livestock and children that are with me,”

33:14	tb57			שֵׂעִֽירָ⁠ה	1	See how you translated “the land of Seir” in Gen 32:3. The land of Seir was a mountainous region southeast of the land of Canaan (and the Dead Sea) and was where Esau had settled. It was also called “Edom” (Gen 32:3), which was Esau’s nickname (Gen 25:30). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “in the land of Seir.”
33:15	twql			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Esau said to Jacob”
33:15	ku53			אַצִּֽיגָה נָּ֣א עִמְּ⁠ךָ֔ מִן הָ⁠עָ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתִּ֑⁠י	1	 Alternate translation: “Okay, then please let me leave you some of my men to escort you.” or “Okay, then may I leave some of my men with you to escort you?”
33:15	phvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Make sure the way you translate this quote margin fits with how you translate the previous and following sentences. Alternate translation: “Jacob said to him,” or “Jacob answered him,”
33:15	a29j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֣⁠מָּה זֶּ֔ה	1	Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize that there is no need for Esau to leave any of his men with him. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to use a statement here instead. Do what is best in your language.
33:15	evmh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics	אֶמְצָא חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽ⁠י	1	Consider again how you translated **my lord** in verses 8,13-15. For some languages it is more natural to put this address earlier in this quote. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the idiom **find favor in the eyes of** in verse 8. Alternate translation: “Just please continue to be gracious to me, sir.” or “Sir, please just continue to treat me kindly.”
33:16	r6yz			וַ⁠יָּשָׁב֩ בַּ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠ה֥וּא עֵשָׂ֛ו לְ⁠דַרְכּ֖⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “So that very day Esau and his men started on their way back” or “So that very day Esau and his men left and headed back”
33:16	c592			שֵׂעִֽירָ⁠ה	1	See how you translated **Seir** in verse 14. Alternate translation: “home to the region of Seir.”
33:17	moff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠יַעֲקֹב֙ נָסַ֣ע סֻכֹּ֔תָ⁠ה	1	Jacob went northwest to Succoth, instead of going south to the region of Seir as he had said he would do (verse 14). Also see how you translated “travel” in verse 12. Alternate translation: “But Jacob went to the town of Succoth instead,” or “Meanwhile, instead of going to Seir, Jacob and his family went to the town of Succoth,”
33:17	moyc			וַ⁠יִּ֥בֶן ל֖⁠וֹ בָּ֑יִת	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “There he and his servants built a house for himself and his family” or “where he and his men built a house for his family”
33:17	kw1x			וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְנֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ עָשָׂ֣ה סֻכֹּ֔ת	1	The term **livestock** is general here and includes all of Jacob’s animals. Alternate translation: “and they also built some shelters for his livestock” or “and shelters for his animals.”
33:17	oyhe			עַל כֵּ֛ן	1	See how you translated this phrase in Gen 32:32. Alternate translation: “Because of that,”
33:17	tv48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קָרָ֥א שֵׁם הַ⁠מָּק֖וֹם סֻכּֽוֹת	1	The phrase “he/they called” could refer to Jacob, or it could refer to people in general (as it often does in Genesis). If you include the meaning of the name Succoth in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate **shelters** earlier in this verse.
33:18	uqlg			וַ⁠יָּבֹא֩ יַעֲקֹ֨ב שָׁלֵ֜ם עִ֣יר שְׁכֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן בְּ⁠בֹא֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠פַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם	1	Jacob and his family had left Paddan Aram and had been traveling back to the land of his ancestors in Canaan (Gen 31:3, 13, 18). See how you translated **in peace** in Gen 28:21. Alternate translation: “Later Jacob and his family arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, as he continued traveling home from the region of Paddan Aram,” or “After that, Jacob and his family continued their journey home from the region of Paddan Aram, until eventually they arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan,”
33:18	q3jx			וַ⁠יִּ֖חַן	1	Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated **camped** in Gen 26:17. Alternate translation: “and he set up camp in a field” or “Then he set up his tents in a field”
33:18	a1lz			אֶת פְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	 Alternate translation: “near the city.” or “on the edge of the city.”
33:19	dg43			וַ⁠יִּ֜קֶן אֶת חֶלְקַ֣ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה	1	 Alternate translation: “Then he bought the plot of land”
33:19	gedk			אֲשֶׁ֤ר נָֽטָה־שָׁם֙ אָהֳל֔⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “where they had set up their camp” or “where he were camping”
33:19	esul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מִ⁠יַּ֥ד בְּנֵֽי חֲמ֖וֹר אֲבִ֣י שְׁכֶ֑ם בְּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה קְשִׂיטָֽה	1	The weight and value of a hundred kesitahs of silver is not known. Some ancient translations (including the LXX and Latin Vulgate) have “a hundred lambs” here, but most modern translations have “a hundred pieces of silver/money”. Alternate translation: “for one hundred pieces of money from the sons of Hamor who was the father of Shechem.”
33:20	lob7			וַ⁠יַּצֶּב שָׁ֖ם מִזְבֵּ֑חַ	1	See how you translated **altar** in Gen 26:25. Alternate translation: “On that land Jacob also built a stone altar,” or “Jacob also made an altar out of stones on that land,”
33:20	e6k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּ֨קְרָא ל֔⁠וֹ אֵ֖ל אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The name **El Elohe Israel** could also mean “Powerful/Mighty is the God of Israel,” because the Hebrew word “el” can mean “God” or “powerful.” You could put that information in a footnote.
34:1	xwzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠תֵּצֵ֤א דִינָה֙ בַּת־לֵאָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלְדָ֖ה לְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	These events took place at an unspecified time after Jacob and his family set up their camp beside the city of Shechem (Gen 33:18). Consider what is the best way to introduce a new event in your language. Also be consistent here with how you spelled **Dinah** in Gen 30:21. Alternate translation: “Now one day Dinah, who was the daughter whom Leah had for Jacob, went out” or “One day, Dinah, who was the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to the city”
34:1	da5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠רְא֖וֹת	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The verb **to see** could mean: (1) “to visit with”; many languages have a similar idiom. (2) “to see/observe” the local women, for example, how they dressed and what jewelry they wore.
34:1	xo8b			בִּ⁠בְנ֥וֹת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	See how you translated **daughters of the land** in Gen 27:46, and how you translated a similar phrase (“people of the land”) in Gen 23:7, 12. Alternate translation: “some of the women who were native to that area” or “some of the native women.”
34:2	kd4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יַּ֨רְא & שְׁכֶ֧ם בֶּן חֲמ֛וֹר הַֽ⁠חִוִּ֖י נְשִׂ֣יא הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	Consider which order of phrases is best here in your language. Also see how you translated “Hivites” in Gen 10:17 and **ruler** in Gen 25:16. Alternate translation: “Then Shechem, who was the son of the Hivite named Hamor who ruled that region, saw” or “Now the ruler of that region was a Hivite named Hamor. His son Shechem saw”
34:2	ht9l			אֹתָ֜⁠הּ & וַ⁠יִּקַּ֥ח אֹתָ֛⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “Dinah, and he grabbed hold of her” or “how beautiful Dinah was, so he took hold of her”
34:2	ptfl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יִּשְׁכַּ֥ב אֹתָ֖⁠הּ וַ⁠יְעַנֶּֽ⁠הָ	1	This is a euphemistic way of saying that Shechem forced Dinah to have sex with him. Translate this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when hearing your translation read aloud. Alternate translation: “and forced her to go to bed with him.”
34:3	l9qg			וַ⁠תִּדְבַּ֣ק נַפְשׁ֔⁠וֹ בְּ⁠דִינָ֖ה בַּֽת יַעֲקֹ֑ב וַ⁠יֶּֽאֱהַב֙	1	 Alternate translation: “He admired her so much that he fell in love with her”
34:3	nd16			וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֖ר עַל לֵ֥ב הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָֽ	1	See how you translated **young woman** in Gen 24:14, and see the note about that there. Alternate translation: “and spoke tenderly to her to try to persuade her.” or “and tried to win her heart by speaking kindly to her.”
34:4	q2v0			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר שְׁכֶ֔ם אֶל חֲמ֥וֹר אָבִ֖י⁠ו לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Shechem went to his father Hamor and requested”
34:4	u0r8			קַֽח לִ֛⁠י אֶת הַ⁠יַּלְדָּ֥ה הַ⁠זֹּ֖את לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	At that time it was normal for parents to negotiate with another family to get a spouse for their child. The negotiations would include a bride-price and other details. You could put some of that information in a footnote. The term **girl** that Shechem uses here is less respectful than the term “young woman” that is used in verses 3 and 12.
34:5	ern7			וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֣ב שָׁמַ֗ע כִּ֤י	1	 Alternate translation: “When Jacob was told by someone that”
34:5	iqjy			טִמֵּא֙ אֶת דִּינָ֣ה בִתּ֔⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “Shechem had disgraced his daughter Dinah,” or “his daughter Dinah had been disgraced by Shechem,”

34:5	b462			וְ⁠הֶחֱרִ֥שׁ יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	Make sure your translation of this phrase does not mean that Jacob was totally silent. Rather, it means he did not speak about what Shechem had done to Dinah.
34:5	vahs			עַד בֹּאָֽ⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “until they came back home.”
34:6	huzm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֛א חֲמ֥וֹר אֲבִֽי שְׁכֶ֖ם	1	For some languages it is more natural to introduce Shechem here, rather than wait and have him appear too suddenly in verse 11. Do what is best in your language.
34:6	fxey			אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֑ב לְ⁠דַבֵּ֖ר אִתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “to talk with Jacob.”
34:7	ydmu			כְּ⁠שָׁמְעָ֔⁠ם	1	Many translations put “when they heard” with the previous sentence. However, unless someone else told Jacob’s sons the news of what happened, that interpretation contradicts verse 5, which says that Jacob kept quiet about it until his sons got home. Alternate translation: “When they heard that Shechem had raped their sister,”
34:7	cnrm			וַ⁠יִּֽתְעַצְּבוּ֙ הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	See how you translated **grieved** in Gen 6:6. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “they were very shocked”

34:7	csph			כִּֽי נְבָלָ֞ה עָשָׂ֣ה בְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	Notice in this verse that the Hebrew text has both of Jacob’s names, **Jacob** and “Israel,” to emphasize that Shechem had sinned against Jacob and all of his descendants (the people of Israel). You could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of **Israel** does not refer here to a place, since Israel was not yet a country or a territory. Alternate translation: “that Shechem had disgraced the family of Israel”
34:7	wf5f			וְ⁠כֵ֖ן לֹ֥א יֵעָשֶֽׂה	1	 Alternate translation: “Such a wicked thing should never be done by anyone!” or “No one should ever do such a wicked crime!”
34:8	omfw			וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר חֲמ֖וֹר אִתָּ֣⁠ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	 Alternate translation: “But Hamor pleaded with Jacob and his sons and said,” or “But Hamor begged Jacob and his sons,”
34:8	ma3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בְּ⁠בִתְּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The pronoun **your** is plural here, which shows that Hamor is addressing not only Jacob but also his sons. Alternate translation: “My son Shechem has fallen completely in love with your daughter and sister.”
34:8	sx6u			תְּנ֨וּ נָ֥א אֹתָ֛⁠הּ ל֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	The way **give** and “take” are used in verses 8, 9, 12, 16 and 21 reflects the culture at that time, when parents or families arranged marriages for their daughters.

So that is why Hamor is offering this in exchange for Jacob allowing his family to intermarry with the Hivites. Alternate translation: “The land is available for you to choose what you want; settle in it wherever you want. You can also trade freely here,” or “You can settle wherever you want in the land.

It could include things like money, land, and livestock. The term **gift** probably refers to additional gifts given to the bride and her family members (as in Gen 24:53). If the custom of paying a dowry is not known in your culture, you could include an explanation in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Set the dowry and wedding gifts that I must pay to marry her as high as you want,”

Also see how you translated “give … daughters … take … daughters …” in verse 9.

Cities were surrounded by walls (that had gates) for protection. You could put some of that information in a footnote so that people understand what was happening. Alternate translation: “and they spoke to the city elders who had gathered there. They said,” or “and they told the leaders of their city about Jacob and his sons,”

Even though Shechem was the one who actually defiled Dinah (verses 2, 5, 7, 13), Jacob’s sons held everyone in the city responsible for the crime that their ruler’s son had committed (verses 25-29). If that is not clear, you could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of **they** does not refer to Jacob’s sons.

35:1	j11q			עֲלֵ֥ה בֵֽית אֵ֖ל וְ⁠שֶׁב שָׁ֑ם	1	The verb **go up** reflects the fact that the town of Bethel is higher in elevation than the city of Shechem; it does not refer to the direction they were going, which was south.

35:5	bc7c			וַ⁠יְהִ֣י חִתַּ֣ת אֱלֹהִ֗ים עַל הֶֽ⁠עָרִים֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ סְבִיבֹ֣תֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וְ⁠לֹ֣א	1	The Hebrew word “Elohim” probably means **God** in this phrase (as it usually does in the Bible); most English versions translate it that way here. Or it could be an adjective that modifies “dread/terror” and means “great/deep dread/terror” (similar to Gen 23:6, 30:8). See how you translated **dread** in Gen 9:2. Alternate translation: “and God caused the people in the nearby cities to be afraid, so that” or “and God made the people in the nearby cities so afraid that”
35:5	xxat			וְ⁠לֹ֣א רָֽדְפ֔וּ אַחֲרֵ֖י	1	Make sure your translation of **they** refers here to the people in the surrounding towns, not Jacob’s sons. Alternate translation: “no one attacked” or “none of them came after”
35:5	g7og		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּנֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1	Jacob’s sons are mentioned here since they are in focus as the ones who just plundered the city of Shechem; Jacob and the rest of his family were there with his sons and were also in danger. Alternate translation: “them.” or “Jacob and his family.”
35:6	r8n3			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב ל֗וּזָ⁠ה	1	Be consistent in this verse with how you spelled **Luz** and **Bethel** in Gen 28:19. Alternate translation: “Soon Jacob arrived at the town of Luz,”
35:6	zpbn			הִ֖וא בֵּֽית אֵ֑ל	1	See how you translated **which is** in Gen 23:2, 19. Alternate translation: “which is also called Bethel,” or “that is, Bethel,” or “which now has the name Bethel,”
35:6	e1f7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן	1	Since Shechem (verse 4) and Bethel were both in the land or region of Canaan, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this location phrase earlier in the verse and say, “Jacob/He and his family continued traveling in the land/region of Canaan and arrived at the town of Luz, which also/now has the name Bethel,” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “which is also in Canaan,”
35:6	rsay		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ה֖וּא וְ⁠כָל הָ⁠עָ֥ם אֲשֶׁר עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “he and his whole family.”
35:7	iybt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יִּ֤בֶן שָׁם֙ מִזְבֵּ֔חַ	1	Consider again how you translated **altar** throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 8:20; 12:7-8; 13:4, 18; 22:9; 26:25; 33:20; 35:1, 3, 7. Alternate translation: “There he built an altar,” or “Then he built an altar there,”
35:7	n4aj			וַ⁠יִּקְרָא֙ לַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם	1	 Alternate translation: “and he named that place” or “and he named it”
35:7	acaa			כִּ֣י שָׁ֗ם	1	 Alternate translation: “because it was at Bethel that”
35:7	njqv			נִגְל֤וּ אֵלָי⁠ו֙ הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Compare how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“appeared”) in verses 1 and 9. Alternate translation: “God had first introduced himself to him” or “God had first appeared to Jacob”
35:7	l3rr			בְּ⁠בָרְח֖⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated **fleeing** in verse 1. Alternate translation: “while he was running away”
35:7	ww7q			מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י אָחִֽי⁠ו	1	See how you translated **from the presence of** in verse 1. Alternate translation: “from the anger of his brother.”

35:8	cnph			וַ⁠תִּקָּבֵ֛ר	1	 Alternate translation: “and her body was buried by Jacob in the ground” or “They buried her body in the ground”
35:8	gwdm			מִ⁠תַּ֥חַת לְ⁠בֵֽית אֵ֖ל	1	The town of Bethel was built on a hill, so the phrase **below Bethel** means that Deborah was buried near Bethel, in a valley or place that was lower in elevation than the town, and possibly to the south of it. Alternate translation: “in the valley below the town of Bethel,” or “at a place south of the town of Bethel,”
35:8	h6bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	תַּ֣חַת הָֽ⁠אַלּ֑וֹן	1	See how you translated a similar phrase (“under the terebinth/oak tree”) in verse 4. Many translations translate this phrase the same way in both places (“under an oak tree”), even though different Hebrew words are used for the type of tree. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put this phrase before the previous phrase and say, “at the base of an oak tree, below/near the town of Bethel.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “beside an oak tree” or “at the foot of an oak tree.”
35:8	eqj9			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) that people in general called the tree or place Allon Bacuth; or (2) that Jacob was the one who named the place. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 31:38. Alternate translation: “So he named the tree” or “That is why the place is known as”
35:8	iar1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אַלּ֥וֹן בָּכֽוּת	1	If you include the meaning of this name in your translation text or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translated **oak tree** in the previous sentence.

35:9	w0t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “and blessed him” or “and showed his goodness toward him”
35:10	q9rk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמֶר ל֥⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	What God says to Jacob in verses 10-12 is the blessing. So make sure your translation of “blessed” (verse 9) and **said** (verse 10) refers to the same event, not two separate events. See how you translated “blessed … and said” in Gen 1:28. Alternate translation: “by saying to him,”
35:10	bpj9			שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like God was telling Jacob something he did not know.
35:10	qyzi			לֹֽא יִקָּרֵא֩ שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֨ ע֜וֹד יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	Notice that Jacob is referred to by both of his names in this chapter (**Jacob** in verses 11-20, 22-29; **Israel** in verses 10 and 21). You could put that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated this clause in Gen 32:28, and see the note about Jacob’s names there. Alternate translation: “that will no longer be your only name,” or “it will no longer be that,”
35:10	nvm1			כִּ֤י אִם יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Rather, your name will also be Israel!” or “Rather, you will also have the name Israel!”
35:10	kx9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א אֶת שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	This was not the first time God had given Jacob the name Israel (See: Gen 32:28). To make that clear, you could make “once again” explicit here.
35:11	ni4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ ל֨⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	In verse 11, God continues the blessing that he started in verse 10, perhaps after a pause. Alternate translation: “Then God also said to him” or “Then God also blessed him by saying,” or “God continued blessing him by saying to him,”
35:11	k8l5			אֲנִ֨י אֵ֤ל שַׁדַּי֙	1	See how you translated the title **God Almighty** in Gen 17:1 and 28:3. Alternate translation: “I am God who is all-powerful.”
35:11	mdi4			פְּרֵ֣ה	1	Consider again how you translated **Be fruitful and multiply** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 1:22, 28; 8:17; 9:1, 7; 35:11. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
35:11	ko42			וּ⁠רְבֵ֔ה	1	 Alternate translation: “and increase in number.” or “so that you and your descendants become very many.”
35:11	uzb9			גּ֛וֹי וּ⁠קְהַ֥ל גּוֹיִ֖ם יִהְיֶ֣ה מִמֶּ֑⁠ךָּ	1	Compare how you translated a similar phrase (“a multitude of nations”) in Gen 17:4-5 and another similar phrase (“a community of peoples”) in Gen 28:3. Alternate translation: “Your descendants will become a large people group. In fact, many ethnic groups will descend from you,” or “Your descendants will become many ethnic groups,”
35:11	ztcs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וּ⁠מְלָכִ֖ים מֵ⁠חֲלָצֶ֥י⁠ךָ יֵצֵֽאוּ	1	The phrase **come from your loins** is an idiom that refers to having children, grandchildren and other descendants. Consider whether you have a similar idiom in your language. Alternate translation: “and kings will descend from you.”
35:12	wfzz			וְ⁠אֶת הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֛תִּי לְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֥ם וּ⁠לְ⁠יִצְחָ֖ק לְ⁠ךָ֣ אֶתְּנֶ֑⁠נָּה וּֽ⁠לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֥ אַחֲרֶ֖י⁠ךָ אֶתֵּ֥ן אֶת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	 Alternate translation: “Also, I am giving to you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, and I will also give it to your descendants who live after you.”
35:13	jeht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַל מֵ⁠עָלָ֖י⁠ו אֱלֹהִ֑ים בַּ⁠מָּק֖וֹם אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated **went up from** in Gen 17:22. Alternate translation: “Then God left Jacob there where he had been speaking to him.”
35:14	apyn			וַ⁠יַּצֵּ֨ב יַעֲקֹ֜ב מַצֵּבָ֗ה	1	See how you translated a similar passage in Gen 28:18 about Jacob setting up a memorial stone pillar. Alternate translation: “Then Jacob set a large stone up on its end” or “Then Jacob chose a large stone that was there and set it up on its end”
35:14	vufy			בַּ⁠מָּק֛וֹם אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּ֖⁠וֹ מַצֶּ֣בֶת אָ֑בֶן	1	 Alternate translation: “at the place where God had spoken to him, to mark the place as special.” or “as a memorial stone to remember the place where God had talked to him.”
35:14	bs34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יַּסֵּ֤ךְ עָלֶ֨י⁠הָ֙ נֶ֔סֶךְ וַ⁠יִּצֹ֥ק עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ שָֽׁמֶן	1	A drink offering was probably wine that Jacob poured on the stone as a sacrifice to God, to worship and thank him. See how you translated “poured oil on …” in Gen 28:18. Alternate translation: “Then he poured some wine and some olive oil on the stone pillar to thank God and dedicate the place to him.”
35:15	r8mu			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב אֶת שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מָּק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁר֩ דִּבֶּ֨ר אִתּ֥⁠וֹ שָׁ֛ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בֵּֽית אֵֽל	1	See how you translated “called the name of that place Bethel” in Gen 28:19.
35:16	zgdt			וַ⁠יִּסְעוּ֙ מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אֵ֔ל	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Bethel** throughout the book of Genesis and whether you refer to it as a town or a city. See Gen 12:8; 13:3; 28:19; 31:13; 35:1, 3, 7, 15, 16. Alternate translation: “Then they left the town of Bethel” or “Later Jacob and his family moved on from the town of Bethel”
35:16	pluk			וַֽ⁠יְהִי ע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ לָ⁠ב֣וֹא אֶפְרָ֑תָה	1	The phrase **a distance of land** is very general, but your translation should not make it sound like the distance was too far, because Rachel’s grave is about two kilometers (one mile) from Ephrath (Bethlehem). Alternate translation: “and started heading toward the town of Ephrath. But while they were still a distance away from there,”
35:16	hid6			וַ⁠תְּקַ֥שׁ בְּ⁠לִדְתָּֽ⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “but she was having a very difficult time delivering the baby.”
35:17	lkqs			וַ⁠יְהִ֥י בְ⁠הַקְשֹׁתָ֖⁠הּ בְּ⁠לִדְתָּ֑⁠הּ	1	The phrase **hard labor** refers to when childbirth contractions are close together and very painful, often right before a baby is born. Alternate translation: “Then when she was at the most difficult time in her labor,” or “Then when her childbirth pains were the most severe,”
35:17	ojel			וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר לָ֤⁠הּ הַ⁠מְיַלֶּ֨דֶת֙	1	 Alternate translation: “the midwife told her,” or “the baby was born and the midwife who was helping her deliver exclaimed to her,”
35:17	infx			אַל תִּ֣ירְאִ֔י	1	 Alternate translation: “Do not worry”
35:17	uww0			כִּֽי גַם זֶ֥ה לָ֖⁠ךְ בֵּֽן	1	 Alternate translation: “You now have another boy!” or “You just gave birth to another son”
35:18	ob0k			וַ⁠יְהִ֞י בְּ⁠צֵ֤את נַפְשָׁ⁠הּ֙ כִּ֣י מֵ֔תָה	1	Some translations use an idiom here, for example, “as she was taking her last breath” or “as her life was slipping/fading away”, but it is best to translate this in a way that preserves the biblical teaching that at death the soul or spirit leaves the body. Alternate translation: “But Rachel was dying, and as her soul was leaving her body,” or “But in fact Rachel was about to die, and just before her soul left her,”
35:18	lpc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠תִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ בֶּן אוֹנִ֑י	1	The meaning of this name could imply that the child caused Rachel’s death. In the Hebrew text this name is two words connected with a dash (**Ben-oni**). Many translations write it that way or as one word (“Benoni”), and a few translations write it as “Ben Oni.” Any of these spellings is fine.
35:18	yl7o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אָבִ֖י⁠ו	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that this phrase refers to Jacob. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
35:18	qoiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קָֽרָא ל֥⁠וֹ בִנְיָמִֽין	1	The phrase “son of my right hand” is an idiom that means “favored son” or “son of strength.” Alternate translation: “named him Benjamin instead.”
35:19	z9dg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תָּ֖מָת רָחֵ֑ל וַ⁠תִּקָּבֵר֙	1	See how you translated **was buried** in verse 8. Alternate translation: “After Rachel died, her body was buried by Jacob” or “After Rachel died, Jacob buried her body”
35:19	u8c3			בְּ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔תָה	1	 Alternate translation: “beside the road that goes to the town of Ephrath,”
35:19	v561			הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	See how you translated a similar phrase (“which is Bethel”) in verse 6. Alternate translation: “which is also called Bethlehem.” or “that is, Bethlehem.”
35:20	zolc			וַ⁠יַּצֵּ֧ב יַעֲקֹ֛ב מַצֵּבָ֖ה	1	See how you translated this clause in verse 14. Also consider again how you translated **set up** and **pillar** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 28:18, 22; 31:13, 45, 51, 52; 35:14, 20. Alternate translation: “Jacob set a large stone up on its end”
35:20	tkgx			עַל קְבֻרָתָ֑⁠הּ	1	 Alternate translation: “over her burial place to show where it was.” or “to show where her tomb was.” or “to mark the place where he had buried her body.”
35:20	r7ta			עַד הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	The phrase **to this day** refers to the time when the author (Moses) was living. Even in modern times, Rachel’s grave is still marked beside the road about eight kilometers (five miles) south of Jerusalem and two kilometers (one mile) north of Bethlehem. Alternate translation: “in the present day.” or “now.”
35:21	e4g9			וַ⁠יִּסַּ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that **Israel** (verses 21-22) and “Jacob” (verses 20, 22) refer to the same person, not two different people. Alternate translation: “Then Israel that is, Jacob, and his family moved on from there” or “Then Israel and his family started traveling again”
35:21	sykf			וַ⁠יֵּ֣ט אָֽהֳלֹ֔⁠ה	1	 Alternate translation: “and put up his tents”
35:21	fueh			מֵ⁠הָ֖לְאָה	1	This phrase reflects the perspective of Jacob, who was traveling south. Alternate translation: “on the other side of”
35:21	txka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	לְ⁠מִגְדַּל עֵֽדֶר	1	Many translations transliterate **Migdal Eder** (like most other names). Many others translate the meaning of **Migdal** as “the tower” and transliterate “Eder.” A few translate the meaning of the entire name as “the Tower of the Flock.” This was apparently a place near Bethlehem where sheep were raised (Micah 4:8); shepherds may have watched over their flocks from the tower. Alternate translation: “Eder Tower.”
35:22	ls6b			וַ⁠יְהִ֗י בִּ⁠שְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	 Alternate translation: “While Israel and his family were still living” or “During the time that they were living”
35:22	ym5y			בָּ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠הִ֔וא	1	 Alternate translation: “in that region,” or “there,”
35:22	oswk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֔ן וַ⁠יִּשְׁכַּב֙ אֶת	1	Translate this idiom in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud in public. See how you translated “lain with” in Gen 26:10.
35:22	vn3i			וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	See how you translated **heard** in Gen 34:5, 7. Alternate translation: “but Israel found out about it.” or “and Israel was told by someone about it.”
35:22	d6jc			וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר	1	 Alternate translation: “After the birth of Benjamin, Jacob now had a total of twelve sons.”
35:23	fjpl			בְּנֵ֣י לֵאָ֔ה	1	Throughout verses 23-26, many translations have a colon (:) instead of **were**. Do what is best in your language. See what you did in chapter 10. Alternate translation: “The sons he had with his wife Leah were” or “These are the names of the sons he had with his wife Leah:”
35:24	poyp			בְּנֵ֣י רָחֵ֔ל יוֹסֵ֖ף וּ⁠בִנְיָמִֽן	1	 Alternate translation: “The sons Jacob had with Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.” or “These are the names of the sons that Jacob had with his wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.”

It may be necessary to translate this word in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Compare that to how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“slave/servant woman”); see Gen 31:33 for a list of where this word occurs in Genesis.
35:26	f1fu			אֵ֚לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֻלַּד ל֖⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “All those were the sons Jacob had”
35:26	cmuu			בְּ⁠פַדַּ֥ן אֲרָֽם	1	Jacob started having children during the time he was living with Laban in Paddan Aram, but his last son Benjamin was not born until after they had left there (verse 18). Translate this in a way that allows for that.
35:27	qidz			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל יִצְחָ֣ק אָבִ֔י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Jacob came home to his father Isaac who was living” or “Then Jacob continued traveling and came to where his father Isaac was living”

35:27	j8e6			אֲשֶׁר גָּֽר־שָׁ֥ם אַבְרָהָ֖ם וְ⁠יִצְחָֽק	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “where Abraham and Isaac and their families had stayed for a while as outsiders.” or “That is where Isaac and his family had been staying for a while as foreigners and where his father Abraham had also stayed for a while.”
35:28	z6ol			וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֖וּ יְמֵ֣י יִצְחָ֑ק מְאַ֥ת שָׁנָ֖ה וּ⁠שְׁמֹנִ֥ים שָׁנָֽה	1	See how you translated **the days of** in Gen 5:4-31 and 11:32.

35:29	hm56			עַמָּ֔י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “his relatives who had already died.” or “his relatives who had gone before him.” or “his deceased relatives.”
35:29	csuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	זָקֵ֖ן וּ⁠שְׂבַ֣ע יָמִ֑ים	1	For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “Then, after living a long, full life, he breathed/took his last breath, died and joined his ancestors/relatives who had died before him.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “He was very old and had lived a long, full life.”
35:29	wmi4			וַ⁠יִּקְבְּר֣וּ אֹת֔⁠וֹ עֵשָׂ֥ו וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֖ב בָּנָֽי⁠ו	1	See how you translated “his sons … buried him” in Gen 25:9.
36:1	mor4			וְ⁠אֵ֛לֶּה תֹּלְד֥וֹת עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	See how you translated **the generations of** in 25:12, 19. Alternate translation: “Now this is the family-line of Esau,” or “These are the descendants of Esau,” or “Here is the history about the family of Esau,”
36:1	r16h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ה֥וּא אֱדֽוֹם	1	The name Edom means “red” and is the nickname that Esau got for trading his birthright to Jacob for some reddish-colored stew (Genesis 25:29-34). The region of Edom and the Edomites were named after Esau, which is probably why this chapter repeatedly mentions that Esau is Edom. Alternate translation: “who was also called Edom.” or “that is, Edom.”
36:2	guw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֵשָׂ֛ו לָקַ֥ח אֶת נָשָׁ֖י⁠ו מִ⁠בְּנ֣וֹת כְּנָ֑עַן	1	Only the first two wives mentioned in this chapter were Canaanites; see the comment about Basemath at verse 3. The Canaanites were the descendants of Noah’s grandson Canaan (Ham’s son) and included the Hittites and Hivites (verse 2; Genesis 10:15-18) and several other people groups. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Esau had chosen two of his wives from among the Canaanite women:” or “Esau had married two women who were descendants of Canaan”
36:2	ox2j			אֶת עָדָ֗ה	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “whose names were Adah,”

See how you translated “Hittites” in Gen 27:46. Alternate translation: “whose father was Elon, who was a descendant of Heth,” or “the daughter of a man named Elon, who was a member of the Heth people group,”
36:2	y896			וְ⁠אֶת אָהֳלִֽיבָמָה֙	1	Notice that the names of Esau’s two Canaanite wives here are different from the names of his wives mentioned in Gen 26:34. It could be that they each had two names, or these may be different wives that he married later. Alternate translation: “and also Oholibamah,” or “as well as Oholibamah,”
36:2	eq37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בַּת עֲנָ֔ה בַּת	1	Notice that Elon, Anah, and Zibeon are the names of men here, not women.
36:2	evi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	צִבְע֖וֹן הַֽ⁠חִוִּֽי	1	Make sure that your translation of this phrase does not sound like Zibeon was the only Hivite. Consider again how you translated “Hivites” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:17; 34:2; 36:2. Alternate translation: “Zibeon who was a descendant of Hivi.” or “Zibeon who was a member of the Hivi people group.”
36:3	x22q			וְ⁠אֶת בָּשְׂמַ֥ת	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Since this Basemath was a daughter of Ishmael (who was a descendant of Noah’s son Shem), she was not a Canaanite, in contrast to Esau’s first two wives (verse 2). She was also known as Mahalath (Gen 28:9); you could include some of that information in a footnote. Be consistent here with how you spelled Basemath (a different woman with the same name) in Gen 26:34.
36:3	sd2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	בַּת יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל אֲח֥וֹת נְבָיֽוֹת	1	Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child (Gen 25:13), Basemath (Mahalath) was his younger sister, probably from the same mother. Use a kinship term here in your language that fits with those facts. See how you translated **the sister of Nebaioth** in Gen 28:9. Alternate translation: “whose father was Ishmael and whose older brother was Nebaioth.”
36:4	iwl0			וַ⁠תֵּ֧לֶד עָדָ֛ה לְ⁠עֵשָׂ֖ו אֶת אֱלִיפָ֑ז	1	 Alternate translation: “Adah had a son for Esau whom they named Eliphaz,”
36:4	jp5s			וּ⁠בָ֣שְׂמַ֔ת יָלְדָ֖ה אֶת רְעוּאֵֽל	1	Consider whether or not it is best in your language to break this long sentence into two or more shorter sentences. Alternate translation: “while his wife Basemath bore a son named Reuel,”
36:5	j4b4			אֶת יעיש וְ⁠אֶת יַעְלָ֖ם וְ⁠אֶת קֹ֑רַח	1	 Alternate translation: “sons whom they named Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.”

36:6	r7h5			וְ⁠אֶת מִקְנֵ֣⁠הוּ וְ⁠אֶת כָּל בְּהֶמְתּ֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠אֵת֙ כָּל קִנְיָנ֔⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “as well as his livestock and all the rest of his animals and all the other possessions”
36:6	agv2			אֲשֶׁ֥ר רָכַ֖שׁ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1	See how you translated **acquired** and **land of Canaan** in Gen 12:5 and 31:18. Alternate translation: “that he had gotten while they lived in the land of Canaan,”
36:6	efkm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יֵּ֣לֶךְ אֶל אֶ֔רֶץ מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י יַעֲקֹ֥ב אָחִֽי⁠ו	1	For some languages it is more natural to put this clause at the beginning of this verse and say, “Then/Later Esau moved to a land that was away from his brother Jacob. He took with him his wives …” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and he moved to an area that was away from his brother Jacob.” or “and he traveled to a different region and settled there, away from where his brother Jacob was living.”
36:7	pq8b			כִּֽי	1	 Alternate translation: “He did that because” or “The reason Esau moved away is that”
36:7	keey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	הָיָ֧ה רְכוּשָׁ֛⁠ם רָ֖ב מִ⁠שֶּׁ֣בֶת יַחְדָּ֑ו	1	The phrase **their possessions** is general, but here it refers primarily to livestock. Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to both Esau and Jacob’s livestock, not just Esau’s. Alternate translation: “he and Jacob both owned so many livestock that they could no longer live near each other.” or “they both owned so many livestock that they could not live together in the same area”
36:7	zea4			אֶ֤רֶץ מְגֽוּרֵי⁠הֶם֙	1	See how you translated Gen 13:6, which is similar in content to this verse. Alternate translation: “The land where they were living”

So Esau took his wives …” If you do this in your translation, you should label these verses as “6-7”. Alternate translation: “was just not big enough to feed them all because they owned so many animals.” or “did not have enough grazing areas or water to support all the livestock that both families owned”
36:8	lcin			וַ⁠יֵּ֤שֶׁב עֵשָׂו֙	1	 Alternate translation: “That is why Esau and his family” or “That is the reason Esau took his family and”
36:8	hjo1			בְּ⁠הַ֣ר שֵׂעִ֔יר	1	Esau had already been living in the region of Seir (Genesis 32:3, 33:16). Here he moves to the part of that region that had mountains. To make that clear, you could put that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “moved to the hill-country in the land of Seir.” or “went to live in the Seir Mountains.”
36:8	z9jc			עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	 Alternate translation: “That is the history about Esau,”
36:8	mu0g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ה֥וּא אֱדֽוֹם	1	Some translations put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “So Esau, that is, Edom, moved with his family to the mountains of Seir and settled there.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “who was also known as Edom.” or “who was also called Edom.”
36:9	fw7b			וְ⁠אֵ֛לֶּה תֹּלְד֥וֹת עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	Consider again how you translated **generations** in the book of Genesis when it is followed by a genealogy (list of names). See Gen 5:1, 10:1, 11:10, 25:12, 36:9. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “What follows is more of the history of Esau,” or “This is a more detailed genealogy about the descendants of Esau,”
36:9	j31a			אֲבִ֣י אֱד֑וֹם	1	 Alternate translation: “who was the ancestor of the Edom people group”
36:9	lojs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	בְּ⁠הַ֖ר שֵׂעִֽיר	1	Consider again how you translated **mountains** or “hill country” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:30; 12:8; 14:6, 10; 19:17, 19, 30; 22:2, 14; 31:21, 23, 25, 54; 36:8-9, and see the note about this at 10:30. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “who live in the Seir Hills.” or “who live in the hill-country of Seir.”
36:10	g0nv			אֵ֖לֶּה שְׁמ֣וֹת בְּנֵֽי עֵשָׂ֑ו	1	Only two of Esau’s many sons are listed in verse 10.
36:10	ayjo			אֱלִיפַ֗ז בֶּן עָדָה֙ אֵ֣שֶׁת עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Eliphaz** and **Adah** in verse 4. Alternate translation: “Eliphaz, who was the son of his wife Adah,” or “Eliphaz, whom Esau had with his wife Adah,”
36:10	ki4y			רְעוּאֵ֕ל בֶּן בָּשְׂמַ֖ת אֵ֥שֶׁת עֵשָֽׂו	1	See how you spelled **Basemath** and **Reuel** in verse 4. Alternate translation: “and Reuel, who was the son of his wife Basemath.” or “and Reuel, whom Esau had with his wife Basemath.”

Oholibamah was the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon.” or “The sons that Oholibamah had with Esau were Jesush, Jalam, and Korah.

36:15	lses			אֵ֖לֶּה	1	 Alternate translation: “Here is a list of” or “The following are”

See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 8. Alternate translation: “Esau was also known as Edom.” or “Esau was also called Edom.” or “That is the record about Edom.”
36:20	zesq			אֵ֤לֶּה בְנֵֽי שֵׂעִיר֙ הַ⁠חֹרִ֔י יֹשְׁבֵ֖י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	The name “Horites” is an alternate name for the Hivites (verse 2). Also, this genealogy is mentioned here because Seir was the ancestor of Esau’s Canaanite wife Oholibamah (verse 25) and the Seir mountains where Esau was living (verse 8) were probably named after Seir. You could put some of that information in a footnote. See how you translated “Horites” in Gen 14:6. Alternate translation: “Here is a list of the descendants of Seir the Horite who were also living in that land:” or “The sons of Seir the Horite who were also living in that land were”
36:21	jmpu			אֵ֣לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֧י הַ⁠חֹרִ֛י בְּנֵ֥י שֵׂעִ֖יר	1	See how you translated the names of people groups in verses 2. Alternate translation: “Those descendants of Seir became the chiefs of the Horites” or “They were the descendants of Seir who became tribal leaders for the Horites”

36:22	exa7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	וַ⁠אֲח֥וֹת לוֹטָ֖ן תִּמְנָֽע	1	Timna became a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz (verse 12). This genealogy (verses 20-22) also shows that she was the daughter of Chief Seir (since her brother Lotan was the son of Chief Seir). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also, according to Jewish history outside the Bible, Timna was Lotan’s younger sister. If your language has a special term for “younger sister” or “older brother,” you could use one of those here. Alternate translation: “and the name of his sister was Timna.”

36:30	n6gm			אֵ֣לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֧י הַ⁠חֹרִ֛י לְ⁠אַלֻּפֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	Be consistent with how you translated **Horites** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:6; 36:20-21, 29-30. Alternate translation: “Those were the Horite chiefs. They had their own family groups” or “Those were the tribal leaders for the Horites. They had their own tribes”
36:30	pd9g			בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ שֵׂעִֽיר	1	Be consistent with how you spelled **Seir** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:6; 32:3; 33:14, 16; 36:8-9, 20-21, 30. Alternate translation: “and lived in the region of Seir.” or “who were living in the region of Seir.”
36:31	nihl			וְ⁠אֵ֨לֶּה֙ הַ⁠מְּלָכִ֔ים	1	See how you translated **kings** in Gen 17:6 and 35:11. Be sure to distinguish **kings** (verses 31-39) from “chiefs” (verses 15-19, 21, 28, 40-43) in your translation of this chapter. Alternate translation: “These are the names of the kings” or “This is a history about the kings”
36:31	k12n			אֲשֶׁ֥ר מָלְכ֖וּ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ אֱד֑וֹם	1	 Alternate translation: “who ruled over the people of the region of Edom”

Alternate translation: “Jobab, who was the son of Zerah, succeeded Bela as king and ruled from his hometown of Bozrah.”

36:35	bdtf			בִּ⁠שְׂדֵ֣ה מוֹאָ֔ב	1	Moab was a large region located to the east of the Dead Sea. This battle probably took place in the countryside or an unpopulated area (a **field**) within this region. Alternate translation: “in a field in the region of Moab.” or “in the country of Moab.”

Some translations (and ancient versions such as SP, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate) have “Hadad” here instead, in order to spell this name the same way it is spelled in 1 Chronicles 1:50-51. However, that could cause confusion, because “Hadad” is also the name of a different king in verses 35-36 above.
36:39	aq30			וַ⁠יִּמְלֹ֤ךְ תַּחְתָּי⁠ו֙	1	Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 33-39. Alternate translation: “took his place as king” or “succeeded him as king”

Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up this long sentence into two shorter sentences. Alternate translation: “more of the chiefs who descended from Esau. These chiefs led their own family groups in their own territories, which were named after them:” or “more of the descendants of Esau who were tribal leaders; the tribes and the regions where they lived were named after them:”
36:40	ynzj			אַלּ֥וּף תִּמְנָ֛ע אַלּ֥וּף עַֽלְוָ֖ה אַלּ֥וּף יְתֵֽת	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. (1) Most translations treat all the names in verses 40-43 as the names of chiefs (as in the ULT and UST of these verses). (2) However, some scholars think that all the names in verses 40-43 are the names of regions or clans and say, “These are/were the names of the clans/tribes that descended from Esau. Each clan/tribe lived in the land of Edom in its own region that was named after that clan/tribe. The names of the clans/tribes were TImna, Alvan … Iram. Those were the names of the clans/tribes of the Edomites. Each of the clans/tribes lived in their own part of the land of Edom that they owned …”

36:43	aa5c			ה֥וּא עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	 Alternate translation: “That was the record about Esau,” or “This concludes the history about Esau,”
36:43	vois			אֲבִ֥י אֱדֽוֹם	1	See how you translated this phrase in verse 9. Also compare how you translated the names of other people groups in this chapter, including “Hittite” and “Hivite” in verse 2; **Edomites** in verse 9; “Horite/Horites” in verses 20, 21, 29, 30; “Temanites” in verse 34; and “Midianites” in verse 35. Alternate translation: “who was the ancestor of the Edom people group.”
37:1	r483			וַ⁠יֵּ֣שֶׁב יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	Chapter 37 continues the history about Jacob that left off at the end of chapter 35. Begin this chapter in a way that is natural in your language. Make sure the way you translate **lived** allows for the fact that Jacob was already living in Canaan and had settled near the city of Hebron, where his father and grandfather had lived previously (Gen 35:27). Alternate translation: “Now Jacob was still living”
37:1	u237			בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ מְגוּרֵ֣י אָבִ֑י⁠ו בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן	1	See how you translated “sojourned” in Gen 35:27 and **the land of Canaan** in Gen 35:6. Alternate translation: “in the land of Canaan where his father Isaac had lived for a while as a outsider.”
37:2	iyds			אֵ֣לֶּה תֹּלְד֣וֹת יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	Consider again how you translated **These are the generations of** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 2:4; 6:9; 11:27; 25:19; 36:1; 37:2, where what follows is a narrative or history of events. Compare that to Gen 5:1; 10:1; 11:10; 25:12; 36:9, where what follows is more of a genealogy (list of names). It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “This is more of the history about Jacob and his family:” or “What follows tells more about Jacob and his family:”
37:2	hh9m			יוֹסֵ֞ף בֶּן שְׁבַֽע עֶשְׂרֵ֤ה שָׁנָה֙	1	This verse may be referring to a single incident or it may be referring to what happened regularly.

37:2	xjuz			אֶת אֶחָי⁠ו֙ & וְ⁠ה֣וּא נַ֗עַר אֶת	1	As the youngest of these brothers, Joseph was their helper as they took care of their father’s flocks. Alternate translation: “as an helper for his brothers who were”

Also, make sure your translation of **their father** does not sound like the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah had a different father than Joseph had. Alternate translation: “and he told his father about the bad things they were doing.” or “and he gave bad reports to his father about them.”
37:3	tws4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	This verse introduces background information for the events that happen next. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that Jacob (verse 1) and Israel (verse 3) refer to the same person, not two separate people. For a note about this, see Gen 35:10. Alternate translation: “Now Jacob, whose other name was Israel,”
37:3	e4ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי בֶן זְקֻנִ֥ים ה֖וּא ל֑⁠וֹ	1	For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Now Joseph was born to Israel when he was old, so he/Israel loved him more than all the rest of his sons.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “because Joseph was born to him when he was old.”
37:3	ruov		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠עָ֥שָׂה ל֖⁠וֹ כְּתֹ֥נֶת פַּסִּֽים	1	The meaning of the Hebrew text is not certain here. Many translations (including the Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate) say that the tunic or robe was **multicolored** or “colorful.” This **tunic** was probably full-length to the ankles and had long sleeves that reached to the hands. Alternate translation: “So he made a beautiful tunic for him that had many colors.” or “So he made a special colorful robe for him”
37:4	gxph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׂנְא֖וּ אֹת֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָכְל֖וּ דַּבְּר֥⁠וֹ לְ⁠שָׁלֹֽם	1	Make sure it is clear here in your translation that the brothers hated Joseph, not their father. Alternate translation: “they despised Joseph so much that they could not speak to him kindly” or “… they refused to speak to him in a kind way.” or “… they always spoke unkindly to him.”

Wheat and barley were the grains that were common in this region at that time, not corn or oats. Alternate translation: “that we all were out in the middle of a field cutting stalks of grain and tying the stalks into sheaves” or “us working together out in a field cutting and tying sheaves of wheat stalks.”
37:7	hdur			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֛ה	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

37:8	xn5l			וַ⁠יּוֹסִ֤פוּ עוֹד֙ שְׂנֹ֣א אֹת֔⁠וֹ	1	Consider again how you translated **hate** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 24:60; 26:27; 29:31, 33; 37:4-5, 8. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “So they despised him even more strongly than they did before”
37:8	hwgw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל חֲלֹמֹתָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠עַל דְּבָרָֽי⁠ו	1	For some languages, it is more natural to switch the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “So because of what he/Joseph had told them about his dreams, his brothers hated him even more strongly/intensely than they did before.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “for his dreams and for what he told them about the dreams.”
37:9	rdj8			וַ⁠יַּחֲלֹ֥ם עוֹד֙ חֲל֣וֹם אַחֵ֔ר וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֥ר אֹת֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠אֶחָ֑י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “Sometime after that, Joseph told his brothers about another dream that he had.”

37:9	qq77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לִֽ⁠י	1	Bowing down to someone was a way of showing respect and honor to that person. If that is not clear in your culture, you could make that information explicit in your translation or in a footnote. If it is understood, you can leave it implied (as the Hebrew text does). Alternate translation: “to me to show respect.” or “in front of me to honor me.”
37:10	sa4l			וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֣ר אֶל אָבִי⁠ו֮ וְ⁠אֶל אֶחָי⁠ו֒	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Verse 10 could refer to: (1) a second time that Joseph told his dream; for example, “Then/Later Joseph told the same dream to both his father and his brothers, but his father …” or (2) the same time that he told this dream to his brothers in verse 9; for example, “When Joseph related/told the dream to his father and his brothers, his father …”

Also, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “He started wandering around searching in the fields near there, where/and he met a man who asked …” or “As he was wandering around searching in the fields near there, he met a man who asked …” Do what is best in your language.

Myrrh was another type of tree resin that was used as incense and as medicine. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

However, sometimes (as here) the names of those people groups are used interchangeably for the same people (also see Judges 8:22, 24, 26). Perhaps that was because the two people groups had intermarried. Or there may have been merchants from the two people groups in this caravan who bought and sold Joseph together. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “So as the Midianite (that is, Ishmaelite) merchants came by them,” or “So when the Ishmaelite traders who were also called Midianites were going by them,”

38:1	ptef			וַ⁠יֵּ֛ט עַד אִ֥ישׁ עֲדֻלָּמִ֖י	1	The word **Adullamite** refers to the fact that Hirah was from the town of Adullam; it is not the name of a people group. The town of Adullam was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the city of Hebron (37:14), and was lower in elevation, which is why the text says that Judah **went down** to get there. Alternate translation: “and lived in the town of Adullam near the home of a man from there” or “to the town of Adullam and lived near the home of a man from there”

It could mean: (1) “He/Judah was in/at the town of Kezib when she gave birth to Shelah.” or “When she gave birth to Shelah, Judah was in the town of Kezib.” or (2) “It was in the town of Kezib that she gave birth to him/Shelah.” or “She was in Kezib when she gave birth to him/Shelah.”

38:7	roio			וַ⁠יְהִ֗י עֵ֚ר בְּכ֣וֹר יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	Some languages leave **the firstborn of Judah** implied here since Er was already called the firstborn in verse 6. The Hebrew text repeats that information here to emphasize Er’s relationship to Judah in the following events. Do what is best in your language.
38:7	unv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י & רַ֖ע בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	The Hebrew text does not specify what Er had done wrong, so neither should your translation.

38:12	sdjz			וַ⁠יַּ֜עַל & תִּמְנָֽתָ⁠ה	1	Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like Judah had already arrived at Timnah, because he does not actually reach there until verse 19. His trip from the town of Adullam (verse 1) to the town of Timnah was about 13 kilometers (8 miles).

See Gen 4:1 (and note), 17, 25; 19:8; 24:16; 38:26. It may be necessary to translate 38:26 differently, since the relationship in this verse was outside of marriage.

39:3	eyfg			וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא אֲדֹנָ֔י⁠ו כִּ֥י יְהוָ֖ה אִתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	In verses 2 through 20, Potiphar is referred to as Joseph’s master (verses 2-3, 7-8, 16, 19-20) and “the Egyptian” (verse 5); he is no longer mentioned by his name in the Hebrew text. Some translations continue to use Potiphar’s name occasionally in verses 2 through 20 to prevent confusion and make it clear that all of these references refer to the same person, not two or three different people. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated **master** or “owner” in Gen 24:9-10.

Do what is best in your language. Also, Potiphar did more than decide what to eat; that was just one example of personal decisions which were all he had to concern himself with. Alternate translation: “he did not need to concern himself with anything in his household except for personal things like deciding what kind of food he wanted to eat.” or “the only thing he needed to decide about in his household was personal things like what food he wanted to eat.”

But he had given Joseph authority to act in his place over everything in his household. Try to make that clear in your translation.

Alternate translation: “As a result, even he does not exercise more authority in his household than I do”

Some languages must translate this in a way that does not use a negative word such as **not**. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and he has given me freedom with everything in his household, except you, of course, because you are his wife.” or “He allows me to do anything in his household, except with you, his wife.”

Many English translations have omitted this phrase, possibly for reasons of naturalness. Consider whether you have an expression like this that is natural in your language.

Consider again how you referred to Joseph and Joseph’s master, Potiphar, in verses 1-20.

39:23	pxbg			וַֽ⁠אֲשֶׁר ה֥וּא עֹשֶׂ֖ה יְהוָ֥ה מַצְלִֽיחַ	1	See how you translated a similar clause (“Yahweh made all that he was doing successful”) in verse 3. Alternate translation: “and gave him success in whatever he did.” or “and helped him to succeed at everything he did.”

He was in charge of serving Pharaoh anything that he wanted to drink, especially wine. It was his job to test the drink before Pharaoh had some, to make sure it was high quality and not poisoned. Some of that information could be put in a footnote. Also, it may be more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that these were the head officials in these jobs, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “the chief wine-server and the chief baker for the king over Egypt” or “the man who was in charge of those who served wine to the king over Egypt and the man who was in charge of those who baked bread for the king”
40:1	d5ug		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	חָֽטְא֛וּ	1	The text does not say what the officials did wrong that angered Pharaoh. They may have done their jobs poorly in some way. Translate this phrase in a way that fits this context well in your language. Alternate translation: “displeased” or “offended”
40:1	qmtw			לַ⁠אֲדֹנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם לְ⁠מֶ֥לֶךְ מִצְרָֽיִם	1	For some languages it is more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that the king of Egypt was Pharaoh, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “their master, who was Pharaoh the king over Egypt.”
40:2	yt3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּקְצֹ֣ף פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that Pharaoh (verse 2) is the same person as the king of Egypt (verse 1).

Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “the official in charge of serving wine to him and the official in charge of baking bread for him” or “his head wine-server and head baker” or “those two officials”
40:3	sdsb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֨ן אֹתָ֜⁠ם	1	Often in the Bible (as here), when it says that a king (or someone else with authority) did something, it is implied that he had people who were under his authority actually do it. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 39:20. Alternate translation: “So he had them arrested and put”
40:3	dfne			בְּ⁠מִשְׁמַ֗ר	1	 Alternate translation: “under guard”
40:3	e6e3			בֵּ֛ית שַׂ֥ר הַ⁠טַבָּחִ֖ים	1	Apparently the round-house prison was part of the house where the chief of the guards lived and worked, perhaps a lower part (See: Joseph’s use of the word “pit” in verse 15 to refer to this prison). See how you translated “chief/captain of the guards” in Gen 37:36 and 39:1. Alternate translation: “in the house of the captain of the guards,”
40:3	yw2r			אֶל בֵּ֣ית הַ⁠סֹּ֑הַר מְק֕וֹם אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹסֵ֖ף אָס֥וּר	1	See how you translated **bound** in Gen 39:20. Alternate translation: “that is, in the round-house jail, the same prison where Joseph was imprisoned”

Or you could put this sentence earlier in this verse and say, “One night, the king of Egypt’s wine server and baker each had a dream while they were in prison, and each man’s/one’s dream had its own interpretation/meaning.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cupbearer and baker in verse 5 are the same officials as those in verses 2-4. Alternate translation: “This is talking about the wine-server and the baker, who had served the king of Egypt but were in prison.”

Also, notice that **the chief of the bakers** is at the beginning of this clause in the Hebrew text to emphasize him and contrast him with what happened to the chief cupbearer. Do what is natural in your language. See how you translated “hang … on a tree” in verse 19. Alternate translation: “But as for the chief baker, Pharaoh had him executed and hanged on a tree” or “But Pharaoh had his soldiers behead the head baker and impale his body on a pole”

They had power from demons to do miracles (Exodus 7:11, 22; 8:7) and to communicate with the spirits of people who had died.

For some languages, it is confusing to do that, so second person (“you … your …you …”) must be used instead. Some languages have an honorific such as “your Majesty/Honor” that could be used occasionally in these verses instead of third person. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “his officers,”

It could mean: (1) “who has God’s Spirit in him” or “whom God’s Spirit guides” or (2) “who has a divine spirit in him” or “who has a spirit of the gods in him”.

Alternate translation: “no one throughout the entire country of Egypt may do anything unless you tell them to do it!” or “throughout the entire country of Egypt, everyone must only do what you tell them to do!”

Also consider again how you translated **Hebrews** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:13, 39:14, 17; 40:15, 41:12; 43:32. Alternate translation: “Egyptians do not eat at the same table as Hebrew people, because they consider it detestable to do that.” or “The servants did that, because Egyptians consider it unacceptable to eat with Hebrew people at the same table.”

Here, it probably means that they had drunk enough wine that they were feeling happy and sociable. Alternate translation: “Then they ate food, drank wine and feasted with him.” or “Then they feasted and drank wine freely with him until they were very merry.”

46:34	k7fk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תֵּשְׁבוּ֙	1	The idea here is that Jacob’s family would be permitted to live in rural areas to raise their livestock away from most Egyptians, who despised sheep herders.

For example: “My father and my brothers and their families have come to Egypt from the region of Canaan and are now in Goshen Province. They brought with them their sheep …” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “have come here from the land of Canaan.”

It is not clear whether or not they were in the room yet when Joseph spoke to Pharaoh about them (47:1). Alternate translation: “Then he took five of his brothers to Pharaoh and presented them to him.” or “Joseph had brought five of his brothers with him from Goshen, so he brought them before Pharaoh and presented them to him.”

47:4	bami		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֶל פַּרְעֹ֗ה	1	For some languages it is more natural here to omit this quote margin, because the same people (Joseph’s brothers) are still talking to the same person (Pharaoh). However, the words emphasize what Joseph’s five brothers say next and may indicate that there was a pause between what they said in verse 3 and verse 4. Do what is best in your language.

For example: “The famine is so severe/terrible in the region of Canaan where we are/come from that there is not enough grass in the fields for our flocks.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “in the region of Canaan where we are from, because the famine is so severe there.”

47:7	e47i			וַ⁠יְבָ֥רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶת פַּרְעֹֽה	1	In Hebrew, there is a common greeting which means “peace be to you,” so it is possible that Jacob used this blessing of peace here to greet Pharaoh. Alternate translation: “and Jacob greeted and blessed Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob asked God to prosper Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob greeted Pharaoh with a blessing.”
47:8	rcjy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-politeness	כַּ⁠מָּ֕ה יְמֵ֖י שְׁנֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Make sure your translation of Pharaoh’s question about Jacob’s age sounds polite. Also, for some languages, a title of respect (such as “Sir”) is necessary whenever someone addresses a distinguished old man such as Jacob.
47:9	iixc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	 Alternate translation: “Jacob replied,”
47:9	n2qw			יְמֵי֙ שְׁנֵ֣י מְגוּרַ֔⁠י שְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים וּ⁠מְאַ֖ת שָׁנָ֑ה	1	Consider again how you translated “sojournings,” “sojourn,” and “sojourner” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:10; 15:13; 17:8; 19:9; 20:1; 21:23, 34; 23:4; 26:3; 28:4; 32:4; 35:27; 37:1; 47:4, 9. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.

47:10	m5px			וַ⁠יְבָ֥רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶת פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	It was customary in Hebrew to use the blessing “peace be to you” both when greeting and when leaving someone. See how you translated **blessed** in verse 7. Alternate translation: “Then Jacob said goodbye to Pharaoh with a blessing”

If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Later in Egypt’s history, some of the Pharaohs were named Rameses and a city was named after one of them (Exodus 1:11). Alternate translation: “So Joseph gave his father and his brothers the choicest land in the country of Egypt, and they and their families settled there. The property was in Rameses Count, that is, Goshen County,” or “After that, Joseph helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them the choicest property in Egypt, which was in Goshen Province, also known as Rameses Province.”
47:11	qnn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר צִוָּ֥ה פַרְעֹֽה	1	It may be more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “After that, Joseph did what Pharaoh had commanded/told him to do: He helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them property in Rameses Province/County, that is, Goshen Province/County, which was the choicest land in Egypt.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “just as Pharaoh had told him to do.” or “He did exactly as Pharaoh had commanded him to do.”
47:12	fz8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֶ֖חֶם לְ⁠פִ֥י הַ⁠טָּֽף	1	The children are mentioned to emphasize that all the members of the families were well-provided for, including the youngest ones. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph was providing food for everyone in each family, not just the children. Alternate translation: “food, based on how many children were in each family.” or “as much food as each family needed to feed all the children in their family.”
47:13	e2kb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לֶ֤חֶם אֵין֙	1	This clause is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that there was so little food that the people were starving. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Also consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new section that returns to the famine and how it was progressing. Alternate translation: “Now meanwhile, there was no more food” or “Meanwhile, there was almost no food” or “After a while, there was very little food available”
47:13	wyew			בְּ⁠כָל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean: (1) “in all the earth,” or “in the entire known world,” or “anywhere,” which might be an exaggeration (like the previous phrase); or (2) “in all the land,” or “in the/that entire area/region of the earth/world,” which includes Egypt and Canaan (mentioned later in the verse) and other nearby regions and countries. See how you translated **all the earth** in Gen 41:57.
47:13	k3zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי כָבֵ֥ד הָ⁠רָעָ֖ב מְאֹ֑ד	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, for example: “Now after a while, the famine was/became so severe/terrible in the entire world that there was very little food available anywhere.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “because the famine was so severe”

Alternate translation: “As a result, the people in the country of Egypt and the region of Canaan” or “In fact, the people living in the lands of Egypt and Canaan”
47:13	jo5e			וַ⁠תֵּ֜לַהּ	1	The verb **languishing** refers in general to the suffering that the famine was causing, including things such as weakness, fainting and other distress. Some languages have an idiom (like “were wasting away”) that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “were weak” or “were suffering terribly” or “were wasting away”
47:13	n055			מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י הָ⁠רָעָֽב	1	 Alternate translation: “because of the severe lack of food.” or “from hunger.”

Alternate translation: “So when all the silver in the country of Egypt and the region of Canaan had been used up,” or “After the people in Egypt and Canaan had spent all their money,”
47:15	j7jc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָל מִצְרַ֨יִם	1	The word **all** is an exaggeration (hyperbole) which emphasizes that a large number of Egyptians went to Joseph. Consider whether or not it is best to use hyperbole here in your language. Alternate translation: “all the people in Egypt” or “the Egyptians all”
47:15	n6v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֹאוּ֩ & אֶל יוֹסֵ֤ף	1	Consider whether **came** or “went” is more natural here in your language.

47:15	u1c8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	הָֽבָ⁠ה לָּ֣⁠נוּ לֶ֔חֶם	1	Make sure your translation of the people’s request sounds polite, not rude or disrespectful. Also see how you translated **bread** in verses 12-13. Alternate translation: “Sir, please give us food”
47:15	io0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לָ֥⁠מָּה נָמ֖וּת נֶגְדֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	The people use a rhetorical question here to emphasize how desperate they feel.

47:15	rqhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּ֥י אָפֵ֖ס כָּֽסֶף	1	It may be more natural to put this clause first in this quote and say, “Sir, we have no more money to buy grain/food! Please give us food so that we do not starve to death!” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “There is no more money to buy food” or “We have no more money to buy food”
47:16	do9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙	1	 Alternate translation: “Joseph said to them,” or “Joseph replied,”

Alternate translation: “since all your money is gone.” or “since you have spent all your money.”

Also notice that this address is used three times in this verse to show extra respect to Joseph. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: “Our lord we cannot hide from you the fact that”
47:18	ejez			תַּ֣ם הַ⁠כֶּ֔סֶף וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֥ה הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֖ה	1	Consider again how you translated **silver** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:2; 20:16; 23:15-16; 24:35, 53; 31:15; 37:28; 42:25, 27-28, 35; 43:12, 15, 18, 21-23; 44:1-2, 8; 45:22; 47:14-16, 18. It may be necessary to translate this word in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: “our money is gone and our animals” or “not only is our silver all gone, but all our animals also”
47:18	qh1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶל אֲדֹנִ֑⁠י	1	In this verse, the people use the third person (“my/our lord”) to address Joseph in a respectful manner. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: “belong to you, our lord” or “are yours, sir.”

It is different from the word for “land” in the rest of this chapter (in verses 1, 4, 6, 11, 13-15, 27-28). Alternate translation: “We have nothing left to pay you, sir, for grain except ourselves and our land” or “The only way we can pay you for grain is to give you our land and work for you, sir.”
47:19	fbay		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֧⁠מָּה נָמ֣וּת לְ⁠עֵינֶ֗י⁠ךָ גַּם אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ גַּ֣ם אַדְמָתֵ֔⁠נוּ	1	For many languages, the verb **die** does not fit with both people and land, so a different verb must be used for each one. The end of verse 19 specifies how the land would “die.” See how you translated a similar rhetorical question in verse 15. Alternate translation: “What good would it do for us to die and our fields to become ruined” or “Please do not just watch us die or let our land become empty.”

Alternate translation: “Instead, please take us and our fields in exchange for food.” or “Instead please give us food and we will give you our farmland and ourselves to pay for it.”
47:19	b1i6			וְ⁠נִֽהְיֶ֞ה אֲנַ֤חְנוּ וְ⁠אַדְמָתֵ֨⁠נוּ֙ עֲבָדִ֣ים לְ⁠פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Then our fields will belong to King Pharaoh and we will work for him as his servants.”

In that way, Joseph/he bought/acquired all the land/farmland in the country of Egypt for King Pharaoh, so that all the land became Pharaoh’s property.” Do what is best in your language.

The Samaritan Pentateuch (a different Hebrew version) and the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew text) have “made the people slaves” instead, which may refer to the fact that all the people would now be working for Pharaoh, since all the fields belonged to him. The textual variant that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Joseph also moved all the people from their farmlands to the nearby cities”

You could put that information in a footnote.

Alternate translation: “that is still in force now”

See how you translated an idiom with a similar meaning in Gen 15:15. Alternate translation: “When I die and rest with my ancestors,” or “Rather, after I die and join my ancestors who have gone before me,”
47:30	u4cf			וּ⁠נְשָׂאתַ֨⁠נִי֙ מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֔יִם	1	See how you translated **me** in verse 29. Alternate translation: “carry my body out of Egypt to the region of Canaan”

Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah were also buried there (Gen 23:19-20; 25:9-10; 49:31). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated “grave” in Gen 35:20 and a different word with a similar meaning (“burial place”) in Gen 23:4, 6, 9, 20. Alternate translation: “and bury me in the same burial place where their bodies are.”
47:30	qkdh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֕ר	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph is the one speaking here. It may be helpful to read this paragraph aloud to make sure it is clear who is talking at each point in the conversation. Alternate translation: “Then Joseph replied to him,”
47:30	mrsq			אָנֹכִ֖י אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה כִ⁠דְבָרֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	 Alternate translation: “I will do as you requested of me.” or “I will do exactly what you asked me to do.”

47:31	y3zf			עַל רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠מִּטָּֽה	1	The Hebrew text has **at the head of the bed** here, while the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) has “on the top of his staff” instead, which is quoted in Hebrews 11:21. You could include some of that information in a footnote. The difference between versions may be due to the fact that the Hebrew words for **bed** and “staff” are very similar in spelling. Or it could be that Jacob did both; for example, he may have been sitting at the head of his bed and leaning on his staff when he bowed his head and worshiped God. Alternate translation: “as he sat at the top of his bed.” or “as he was lying on his bed.”

Also, make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that **Israel** (verses 2, 8, 11, 13-14, 21) and **Jacob** (verses 2-3) refer to the same person, not two different people. Alternate translation: “Then Israel rallied his strength” or “Immediately Israel, who was lying down, used all his strength”
48:2	d201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֖שֶׁב עַל הַ⁠מִּטָּֽה	1	The context (verse 12) shows that Jacob sat on the edge of his bed with his feet resting on the floor and his knees facing Joseph’s sons.

Alternate translation: “and sat up on the edge of his bed and they greeted each other.”
48:3	owhk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Jacob recounted to Joseph the following:”

48:3	epp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠ל֖וּז בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1	For some languages it is more natural to put the larger place (Canaan) first before the smaller place (Luz) that is located inside it. It may also be more natural to put the time and place phrases first in this verse and say, “Long ago when I was at the town of Luz in the land/region of Canaan, God Almighty …” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you spelled the name **Luz** in Gen 28:19 and 35:6. Alternate translation: “when I was at the town of Luz in the land of Canaan,” or “in the land of Canaan at the town of Luz,”
48:3	ya75			וַ⁠יְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתִֽ⁠י	1	For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “He pronounced a blessing over me there”
48:4	byu6			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֗⁠י	1	Make sure your translation of “blessed … and said” (verses 3-4) refers to the same event, not two separate events. Alternate translation: “He said,”
48:4	m1hy			הִנְ⁠נִ֤י מַפְרְ⁠ךָ֙ וְ⁠הִרְבִּיתִ֔⁠ךָ וּ⁠נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated “make you fruitful and multiply you” in Gen 28:3 and “make him fruitful and … multiply him” in Gen 17:20.

48:5	khph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּ⁠רְאוּבֵ֥ן וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וֹן יִֽהְיוּ לִֽ⁠י	1	For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the names of these sons earlier in the verse and say, “Now then, your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you here in the country of Egypt before I joined you here, I will treat as my sons, just as/like …” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “just as Reuben and Simeon are my sons.” or “just as my sons Reuben and Simeon.”

48:7	jw7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	Jacob is probably explaining in verse 7 that since his favorite wife Rachel died with only two sons, that is why he is treating her son Joseph’s two sons as his sons (verses 5-6). You could make some of that information explicit in your translation or include it in a footnote. Alternate translation: “I want it this way because”
48:7	awjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠בֹאִ֣⁠י	1	Jacob is in focus here, but he was traveling with his family, not alone. Decide whether or not it is necessary to make that explicit in your translation. Alternate translation: “as I and our family were coming home” or “as our family was coming home”
48:7	gfi4			מִ⁠פַּדָּ֗ן	1	Consider again how you translated “the land/region of Paddan Aram” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 25:20 (and note); 28:2, 5-7; 31:18; 33:18; 35:9, 26; 46:15; 48:7. Also, be consistent with how you spelled “Aram” in those verses and in Gen 10:22-23; 22:21; 24:10. Alternate translation: “from the land of Paddan Aram,”
48:7	hucm			רָחֵ֜ל	1	 Alternate translation: “my beloved wife Rachel”
48:7	ykrl			מֵ֩תָה֩ עָלַ֨⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here because the preposition can have different meanings. It could mean: (1) **died beside me** or “died by my side”; or (2) “died, bringing sorrow/grief on/to me”

48:7	p9yz			הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. This phrase might be: (1) Jacob’s words; or (2) the author’s words. If you follow the second interpretation, you could put this phrase within parentheses, outside of the quote marks.
48:8	yv08			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	 Alternate translation: “and asked Joseph,”
48:8	wri5			מִי אֵֽלֶּה	1	Joseph’s two sons were in their 20s at this time, so refer to them here with a term that fits with that fact. They were born before the famine started (Gen 41:50-52), and Jacob had now been in Egypt for 17 years (47:28). Alternate translation: “Whose sons are these?”
48:9	pmfc			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל אָבִ֔י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “Joseph said to him,” or “Joseph replied”
48:9	ycj4			בָּנַ֣⁠י הֵ֔ם אֲשֶׁר נָֽתַן לִ֥⁠י אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	 Alternate translation: “They are my sons whom God gave to me”
48:9	a8xs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֕ר	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation who is speaking here. Alternate translation: “Then Israel said to him,”
48:9	tbew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	קָֽחֶ⁠ם נָ֥א אֵלַ֖⁠י	1	Some languages have a dual pronoun that works well to refer to Joseph’s two sons here (and throughout chapter 48). Do what is best in your language.
48:9	tqwb			וַ⁠אֲבָרֲכֵֽ⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “so that I can ask God to prosper them.”
48:10	w5i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ כָּבְד֣וּ	1	Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a conjunction (**Now**) to begin this clause that gives background information about Israel. Also, the word **heavy** is used here as an idiom that means Israel’s eyesight was getting bad, but he could still see some (as indicated in verses 8 and 11). Many languages have a similar idiom. A translation of verse 10 should not imply that Israel was completely blind. Alternate translation: “Israel had very bad eyesight”
48:10	nhh8			מִ⁠זֹּ֔קֶן	1	 Alternate translation: “because he was very old,”
48:10	igr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠רְא֑וֹת	1	For some languages it is more natural to switch the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “Now Israel was very old, so his eyesight was failing and he was not able to see very well.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “so that he could not see very well.”
48:10	m3l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֤שׁ אֹתָ⁠ם֙ אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation whom is being referred to at each point in this sentence. Alternate translation: “So Joseph brought his sons near to his father,” or “So he had his sons stand near to his father,”
48:10	xi1y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּשַּׁ֥ק לָ⁠הֶ֖ם	1	It may be helpful to read this sentence aloud in your translation to make sure the use of nouns and pronouns is natural and accurate in your language. Alternate translation: “and Israel kissed them on the cheeks” or “and his father kissed …”
48:10	yxhu			וַ⁠יְחַבֵּ֥ק לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	Consider again how you translated the word **embraced** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 29:13; 33:4; 48:10. Also compare that to how you translated an idiom (“fell on … neck”) that has a similar meaning in Gen 33:4; 45:14, 46:29. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.
48:11	joqe			רְאֹ֥ה פָנֶ֖י⁠ךָ לֹ֣א פִלָּ֑לְתִּי	1	 Alternate translation: “I did not think I would ever see you again,”
48:11	cko4			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	 Alternate translation: “but amazingly,”
48:11	w75i			הֶרְאָ֥ה אֹתִ֛⁠י אֱלֹהִ֖ים גַּ֥ם אֶת זַרְעֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	 Alternate translation: “God has allowed me to see even your offspring” or “God has also allowed me to see your offspring”
48:12	wvkp			וַ⁠יּוֹצֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “Then Joseph took his sons away” or “Then Joseph had his sons step away”
48:12	agib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מֵ⁠עִ֣ם בִּרְכָּ֑י⁠ו	1	Joseph’s sons (who were in their 20s) were near Israel's knees, so that he could hug them; they were not sitting on his knees or lap. Also make sure your translation of **his** refers to Joseph's father (Israel/Jacob), not Joseph. Alternate translation: “from near his father,”
48:12	kz74			וַ⁠יִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ	1	 Alternate translation: “and he prostrated himself before him”
48:12	jfto		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לְ⁠אַפָּ֖י⁠ו אָֽרְצָ⁠ה	1	Joseph bowed to the ground to show thankfulness and respect to his father and possibly also to God. If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Alternate translation: “with his face toward the ground in thankfulness and respect.”
48:13	ixv8			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֣ח יוֹסֵף֮	1	 Alternate translation: “Then he took”
48:13	wvf8			אֶת שְׁנֵי⁠הֶם֒	1	 Alternate translation: “both of his sons,”
48:13	nzul			אֶת אֶפְרַ֤יִם בִּֽ⁠ימִינ⁠וֹ֙	1	 Alternate translation: “with Ephraim at his right hand”

48:13	o7vq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֖שׁ אֵלָֽי⁠ו	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Then he took/brought his sons close to his father again. He had Ephraim stand in front of Israel’s left hand/side, and he had Manasseh stand in front of Israel’s right hand/side.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “and he took them close to his father again.”
48:14	vklj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠אֶת שְׂמֹאל֖⁠וֹ עַל רֹ֣אשׁ מְנַשֶּׁ֑ה שִׂכֵּל֙ אֶת יָדָ֔י⁠ו	1	In the Hebrew culture, the right side was the place of highest honor and using the right hand to bless someone was symbolic of giving greater honor to that person. The oldest son was also the one who normally received the greater blessing. Israel reverses that here and gives Joseph’s younger son the greater blessing. It may be important to include a footnote in your translation that gives this information.
48:14	jxo4			כִּ֥י	1	Make sure that the way you translate **because** fits with the fact that Israel wanted to place his right hand on Ephraim (to give him the greater blessing), even though Manasseh was the firstborn (who would normally receive the greater blessing in that culture). Alternate translation: “in spite of the fact that”
48:15	llyx			וַ⁠יְבָ֥רֶךְ אֶת יוֹסֵ֖ף וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	Israel blessed Joseph by blessing Joseph’s sons (verses 15-16, 19-20). Alternate translation: “Then Israel blessed Joseph by blessing his sons and saying,”
48:15	gsdn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֡ים	1	For some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit here that this prayer is a blessing for Joseph’s sons (rather than waiting until that is made clear in verse 16). Do what is best in your language. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up the long sentence in verses 15-16 into shorter sentences.  Alternate translation: “May God bless your sons, the God” or “I pray that God will bless your sons, the God” or “I ask God to bless your sons. He is the God”
48:15	iwxf			אֲשֶׁר֩ & אֲבֹתַ֤⁠י & אַבְרָהָ֣ם וְ⁠יִצְחָ֔ק	1	 Alternate translation: “whom my forefathers Abraham and Isaac”
48:15	r8jy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִתְהַלְּכ֨וּ & לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙	1	See how you translated the idiom “walk/live before” in Gen 17:1 and 24:40. You may need to translate it differently in different contexts. Alternate translation: “walked with according to his will,” or “lived obediently in the presence of,” or “obeyed,”
48:15	bi81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙ הָ⁠רֹעֶ֣ה אֹתִ֔⁠י	1	The word “shepherded” includes guiding, protecting, and providing food and water, such as a shepherd would do for his sheep. Here it is used as a metaphor that refers to God’s complete care of Israel throughout his life. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to use a similar metaphor here. For example, you could say, “He is the same God who, for my entire life, has taken care of all my needs, just as a good shepherd takes care of his sheep.” Alternate translation: “the same God who has watched over me” or “He is the same God who has taken care of me”
48:15	dt5m			מֵ⁠עוֹדִ֖⁠י עַד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	 Alternate translation: “from the beginning of my life until the present day”
48:16	wzng		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	הַ⁠מַּלְאָךְ֩ הַ⁠גֹּאֵ֨ל אֹתִ֜⁠י מִ⁠כָּל רָ֗ע	1	Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also consider again how you translated “angel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 16:7, 9-11; 19:1, 15; 21:17; 22:11, 15; 24:7, 40; 28:12; 31:11; 32:3, 6; 48:16. Alternate translation: “He is also the Angel who rescued me continually from all harm”
48:16	hkqg			יְבָרֵךְ֮ אֶת הַ⁠נְּעָרִים֒	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here; your decision will depend on how you translated verse 15. Also, since Joseph’s sons were probably in their 20s, make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like they were little boys. The Hebrew word for “boy” here can also be translated as “lad,” “servant,” or “young man,” depending on the context and who is speaking to whom. With that in mind, consider again how you translated this word in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:24; 18:7; 19:4; 21:12, 17-20; 22:3, 5, 12, 19; 25:27; 34:19; 37:2; 41:12; 43:8; 44:22, 30-34; 48:16. Alternate translation: “I ask that he will cause these young men to prosper greatly,”
48:16	b0ar			וְ⁠יִקָּרֵ֤א בָ⁠הֶם֙ שְׁמִ֔⁠י וְ⁠שֵׁ֥ם אֲבֹתַ֖⁠י אַבְרָהָ֣ם וְ⁠יִצְחָ֑ק וְ⁠יִדְגּ֥וּ לָ⁠רֹ֖ב בְּ⁠קֶ֥רֶב הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	 Alternate translation: “so that my family name and the family name of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac will continue through them and so that they will have many descendants on the earth.” or “I pray that they will have many descendants on the earth who will carry on the family name for me and for my forefathers Abraham and Isaac.”
48:17	guyi			וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא יוֹסֵ֗ף כִּי יָשִׁ֨ית אָבִ֧י⁠ו יַד יְמִינ֛⁠וֹ עַל רֹ֥אשׁ אֶפְרַ֖יִם	1	See how you translated **placed** in verse 14.
48:17	krcr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֵּ֣רַע בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “it displeased him,” or “he was unhappy about it,”
48:17	fa1f			וַ⁠יִּתְמֹ֣ךְ יַד אָבִ֗י⁠ו	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
48:18	yr6r			לֹא כֵ֣ן אָבִ֑⁠י כִּי זֶ֣ה הַ⁠בְּכֹ֔ר	1	 Alternate translation: “Not like that, Father. It is the other son who is my firstborn” or “That is the wrong one Father. The other one is my oldest son.”
48:18	fe3w			שִׂ֥ים יְמִינְ⁠ךָ֖ עַל רֹאשֽׁ⁠וֹ	1	 Alternate translation: “So you need to put your right hand on his head.”
48:19	fnt6			וַ⁠יְמָאֵ֣ן אָבִ֗י⁠ו	1	 Alternate translation: “But his father refused to move his hands”
48:19	ad6m			יָדַ֤עְתִּֽי בְנִ⁠י֙ יָדַ֔עְתִּי	1	 Alternate translation: “I know it my son, I know what I am doing.” or “I know what I am doing, my son.”

Alternate translation: “In fact, the descendants of your firstborn son will also become a ethnic group, and he will be a great man.” or “In fact, your firstborn son will also be a important man, and he will be the ancestor of a people group.”
48:19	d8w8			וְ⁠אוּלָ֗ם אָחִ֤י⁠ו הַ⁠קָּטֹן֙ יִגְדַּ֣ל מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	 Alternate translation: “However, his younger brother Ephraim will be even greater than he will be,”
48:19	w3o5			וְ⁠זַרְע֖⁠וֹ	1	Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Ephraim’s descendants, not Manasseh’s. Alternate translation: “with many descendants, who”
48:19	ncm9			יִהְיֶ֥ה מְלֹֽא הַ⁠גּוֹיִֽם	1	Compare how you translated a similar phrase (“a community of peoples”) in verse 4. Alternate translation: “will become many ethnic groups.”
48:20	mzc0			וַ⁠יְבָ֨רֲכֵ֜⁠ם בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠הוּא֮	1	 Alternate translation: “That same day, Israel blessed both of them”
48:20	j6nq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמוֹר֒	1	 Alternate translation: “and said,”
48:20	zb3n			בְּ⁠ךָ֗ יְבָרֵ֤ךְ יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	 Alternate translation: “The people of Israel will use your names when they bless someone” or “When the people of Israel say a blessing over someone, they will use your names”
48:20	fkzh			יְשִֽׂמְ⁠ךָ֣ אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	 Alternate translation: “May God bless you” or “We ask God to make you great”
48:20	pdwp			כְּ⁠אֶפְרַ֖יִם וְ⁠כִ⁠מְנַשֶּׁ֑ה	1	 Alternate translation: “like he blessed Ephraim and Manasseh.”
48:20	uje7			וַ⁠יָּ֥שֶׂם אֶת אֶפְרַ֖יִם לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י מְנַשֶּֽׁה	1	 Alternate translation: “When he said that, he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.” or “In that way, he made Ephraim greater than Manasseh.”
48:21	d5t4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶל יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	 Alternate translation: “Next Israel spoke to Joseph. He said,”

48:21	fjrl			אָנֹכִ֖י מֵ֑ת	1	 Alternate translation: “I will die soon,”
48:21	yses		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ עִמָּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The pronouns **you** and **your** are plural throughout this verse and probably refer to all Israel’s family, including Joseph, his brothers, and their descendants. Alternate translation: “but God will always stay with all of you and help you,” or “but God will always stay with you and your brothers and all your descendants and help you.”
48:21	ydkc			וְ⁠הֵשִׁ֣יב אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He will also bring you back”
48:21	orx3			אֶל אֶ֖רֶץ אֲבֹתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	 Alternate translation: “to the land that he gave to your forefathers”
48:22	xrzo			וַ⁠אֲנִ֞י נָתַ֧תִּֽי לְ⁠ךָ֛	1	The pronouns **you** and **your** shift to singular in verse 22. Alternate translation: “And I bequeath to you as part of your inheritance”
48:22	cazk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שְׁכֶ֥ם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could refer to: (1) “the city of Shechem,” or (2) “a mountain slope/ridge,” This second interpretation comes from the meaning of the Hebrew word “shekem” (“shoulder”), which can be used as a metaphor to refer to a mountain slope or ridge.
48:22	peu5			אַחַ֖ד עַל אַחֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	 Alternate translation: “which is more land than I am giving to your brothers and”
48:22	bfda			אֲשֶׁ֤ר לָקַ֨חְתִּי֙ מִ⁠יַּ֣ד	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “which I took control of from” or “I took that land from”
48:22	q9pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הָֽ⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י בְּ⁠חַרְבִּ֖⁠י וּ⁠בְ⁠קַשְׁתִּֽ⁠י	1	For some languages it may be clearer to change the order of clauses in this verse and say, “Besides that, I hereby give you the city of Shechem, which I took/captured from the Amorites when I defeated them in battle. This is more land than I am giving to your brothers.” Do what is best in your language. Also consider again how you translated **Amorites** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:16; 14:7, 13; 15:16, 21; 48:22. Alternate translation: “the Amorites in battle using my sword and my bow.”
49:1	i8ic			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶל בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	The events in chapter 49 may have occurred on the same day as the events in chapter 48, or not very long after that. Consider again how you translated **called for** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:18; 14:14; 20:2, 8-9; 24:57-58; 26:9; 27:1, 42; 28:1; 31:4; 39:14; 41:8, 14; 46:33; 47:29; 49:1.
49:1	g7x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
49:1	l6m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	הֵאָֽסְפוּ֙	1	Much of what Jacob says to his sons in verses 1-27 is Hebrew poetry, which is characterized by the use of parallelisms and metaphors to emphasize important points. Many translations put these verses in poetry format (starting here); many others use regular paragraph formatting. Do what is best in your language. For a complete list of verses that some translations treat as poetry in the book of Genesis, see the introduction to the book. Alternate translation: “Gather yourselves together before me,”
49:1	upew			וְ⁠אַגִּ֣ידָה לָ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	 Alternate translation: “and I will declare to you” or “so that I can inform you”
49:1	gmu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר יִקְרָ֥א אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Much of what Jacob prophesies in this chapter about his sons also applies to their descendants. Some translation teams may prefer to put that information in a footnote rather than make it explicit in the text. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated **meet** in Gen 42:4, 38.
49:1	xg3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠אַחֲרִ֥ית הַ⁠יָּמִֽים	1	In this context, this phrase refers to a period of years in the future. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: “in the days ahead.” or “in future days”
49:2	j5co		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הִקָּבְצ֥וּ וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that Jacob is talking to his own sons and is referring to himself as both Jacob and as Israel. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put the address **sons of Jacob** first in verse 2, or even first in the quote (which begins in verse 1). Do what is best in your language.
49:2	xh8b			וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וּ אֶל יִשְׂרָאֵ֥ל אֲבִי⁠כֶֽם	1	This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause to emphasize that Jacob wants his sons to listen to him carefully. Try to keep both halves of this parallelism in your translation, since each half has a slightly different focus. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Pay attention to me, your father Israel.”
49:3	tmwk			רְאוּבֵן֙ בְּכֹ֣רִ⁠י אַ֔תָּה	1	Consider again how you translated **firstborn** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:4; 10:15; 19:31, 33-34, 37; 22:21; 25:13, 27; 27:19, 32; 29:26; 35:23; 36:15; 38:6-7; 41:51; 43:33; 46:8, 14; 48:18; 49:3. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
49:3	wp60		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	כֹּחִ֖⁠י וְ⁠רֵאשִׁ֣ית אוֹנִ֑⁠י	1	This phrase is used here as a euphemistic idiom that refers to Jacob’s ability to have children. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Translate this in a way that will not embarrass or offend listeners. Alternate translation: “the result of my fertility, and the first child I had as a young man.” or “You are the first sign of my manhood and strength”
49:3	zu3n			יֶ֥תֶר שְׂאֵ֖ת וְ⁠יֶ֥תֶר עָֽז	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You had higher honor and authority than all your brothers.”
49:4	ngg3			פַּ֤חַז	1	 Alternate translation: “However, you are uncontrollable” or “However, you are reckless”
49:4	m3c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙	1	Here Jacob compares Reuben’s reckless, uncontrolled sexual behavior to turbulent water that is out of control and destructive. Consider whether or not you have a similar simile in your language that would fit well here. Alternate translation: “like a flood of water,”
49:4	ht6q			אַל תּוֹתַ֔ר	1	 Alternate translation: “so you will no longer have your high position in our family,” or “so you will no longer be first among your brothers,”
49:4	s4lx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	כִּ֥י עָלִ֖יתָ מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אָבִ֑י⁠ךָ אָ֥ז חִלַּ֖לְתָּ	1	This clause, along with the rest of the verse, is a euphemistic way of referring to Reuben committing adultery by sleeping with his father’s concubine (secondary wife) Bilhah (Genesis 35:22). Alternate translation: “because you got into my bed with my wife and dishonored me!” or “because you dishonored me by getting into my bed and committing adultery with my concubine”
49:4	u62z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יְצוּעִ֥⁠י עָלָֽה	1	Here Jacob repeats part of what he said in the previous clause, in order to emphasize Reuben’s sin against him and to communicate how upset he is about it. He may have still been talking to Reuben (switching from second to third person), or he may have been exclaiming about Reuben to himself and the rest of his sons.
49:5	jadm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	שִׁמְע֥וֹן וְ⁠לֵוִ֖י	1	In verses 3-27, Jacob sometimes refers to his sons using second person (“you”), and sometimes (as here) he uses third person (“they” or “he”). Consider whether or not it is better in your language to use second person throughout these verses, especially since Jacob is talking to his sons who are right there with him. Also, some languages have dual pronouns that fit well in verses 5-7. Alternate translation: “As for Simeon and Levi, they”
49:5	lnz6			אַחִ֑ים	1	This phrase is used here as an idiom that emphasizes the fact that Simeon and Levi thought alike and acted together to do evil things. Alternate translation: “are close brothers.” or “are partners in crime.” or “do evil things together.”
49:5	hpdj			כְּלֵ֥י חָמָ֖ס מְכֵרֹתֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Make sure in your translation that the pronouns you use here (and in verses 6-7) fit with the way you translated the beginning of this verse. Alternate translation: “They use their weapons to do violent things together.”
49:6	sbst		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אַל תָּבֹ֣א נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	Here Jacob uses the phrase **my soul** to refer to himself and to emphasize how strongly he feels about what he is saying. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: “Do not ever let me” or “May I never”
49:6	h9hm			בְּ⁠סֹדָ⁠ם֙ אַל־תָּבֹ֣א	1	In verses 5-7, Jacob is probably referring to the time when Simeon and Levi killed all the males in the city of Shechem out of revenge (Genesis 34:25-26, 30). Jacob was very upset that they did that. Alternate translation: “take part in their evil plans” or “participate with them when you plan evil things!”
49:6	z996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בִּ⁠קְהָלָ֖⁠ם אַל תֵּחַ֣ד כְּבֹדִ֑⁠י	1	This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause and emphasizes that Jacob is upset and does not want to participate with these two sons in their evil behavior. Consider what is the best way to translate that in your language. Alternate translation: “Do not let my honor be associated with your evil plans,” or “I never want to be linked with their evil plans,” or “I refuse to make evil plans with them”
49:6	ckzx			כִּ֤י בְ⁠אַפָּ⁠ם֙ הָ֣רְגוּ אִ֔ישׁ	1	The phrase **a man** probably refers collectively here to all the men whom these two sons killed in the city of Shechem (Gen 34:25-26, 30). Alternate translation: “because you became angry and murdered many men”
49:6	z1y0			וּ⁠בִ⁠רְצֹנָ֖⁠ם עִקְּרוּ שֽׁוֹר	1	This may have happened during the time that Simeon and Levi took revenge on the people of Shechem. Alternate translation: “and just to please yourselves, you crippled some oxen so they could not walk.” or “and you cut the leg tendons of some oxen just for the fun of it.”

49:7	ykq9			אֲחַלְּקֵ֣⁠ם	1	The last half of verse 7 specifies how Jacob is asking God to curse Simeon and Levi. Alternate translation: “I ask God to disperse them and their descendants” or “May he cause them and their descendants to be spread out”
49:7	f5mw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	In this context, the name **Jacob** refers to his family and especially his descendants. Alternate translation: “among the family of Jacob.”
49:7	b95x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַ⁠אֲפִיצֵ֖⁠ם	1	The clauses “I will divide …” and “I will scatter …” form a parallelism that emphasizes the way Jacob is asking God to curse Simeon and Levi. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of a parallelism in your translation. Alternate translation: “Yes, I will”
49:7	e9qw			וַ⁠אֲפִיצֵ֖⁠ם	1	Consider again how you translated **scatter** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:18, 32; 11:4, 8-9; 49:7. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. If the pronoun “you” is used here in your translation, it should be plural. Alternate translation: “disperse you” or “cause them to be spread out”
49:7	ih68			בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Jacob’s prophecy in verse 7 came true many years later: the tribe of Simeon was absorbed by the tribe of Judah (Joshua 19:1), and the tribe of Levi never had its own territory, but rather lived in cities scattered throughout the other tribes of Israel (Joshua 21:1-42). You could put this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “throughout the descendants of Israel.”
49:8	mfza			יְהוּדָ֗ה אַתָּה֙ יוֹד֣וּ⁠ךָ אַחֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	In the Hebrew text, the pronoun **you** is emphatic, and it has an emphatic position in the sentence.

Alternate translation: “Judah, you are the one whom your brothers will praise.” or “Judah, you and your descendants will be highly praised by your brothers and their descendants.”
49:8	lhkv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ בְּ⁠עֹ֣רֶף	1	Consider what is the best way to translate this Hebrew idiom in your language.

49:8	o2b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	יִשְׁתַּחֲוּ֥וּ לְ⁠ךָ֖	1	Consider again how you translated **bow down** in the book of Genesis.

For some languages it is better to use second person references (“you, your”) throughout verses 8-12. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “You are like a lion that stretches out and lies down to rest after eating.”
49:9	tf30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠כְ⁠לָבִ֖יא מִ֥י יְקִימֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	This sentence forms a parallelism with the previous sentence to emphasize Judah’s authority. Also, Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize the respect that people will have for Judah. Some languages must use a statement here instead. Do what is best in your language.

49:10	f9a1			עַ֚ד כִּֽי יָבֹ֣א שִׁיל֔וֹ	1	Jacob is probably prophesying here about the coming of the Messiah/Christ. This fits with the fact that Jesus was a descendant of the tribe of Judah and is now ruling as the true King over heaven and earth. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “until the highest king arrives” or “until the One whom the scepter belongs to comes”
49:10	jg91			וְ⁠ל֖⁠וֹ יִקְּהַ֥ת עַמִּֽים	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “and the nations of the earth obey him.” or “and all people obey him.” or “All people will obey him.”
49:11	tpc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹסְרִ֤י	1	In verse 11, the pronouns “he” and **his** refer to Judah and his descendants. To make that clear, you could make that explicit here and then use plural pronouns “they” and “their” throughout the verse. Or if you are using the second person throughout this section, you could say, “You and your descendants …” and use plural pronouns “you” and “your” after that.

49:11	nav1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֹסְרִ֤י לַ⁠גֶּ֨פֶן֙ עִיר֔וֹ	1	In Jacob’s culture grapevines were valuable plants, so unless a person was very rich, he would never tether a donkey to his grapevines because it would eat the fruit and the vines.

49:12	s3uy			עֵינַ֖יִם	1	 Alternate translation: “Their eyes” or “You will be so blessed that your eyes”
49:12	cm3s			חַכְלִילִ֥י & מִ⁠יָּ֑יִן	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here.

49:12	rmn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠לְבֶן־שִׁנַּ֖יִם מֵ⁠חָלָֽב	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “and their/your teeth will be white from drinking abundant milk.” or (2) “and their/your teeth will be whiter than milk.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase fits with the interpretation you used for the first part of this verse.

49:14	e90c			בֵּ֥ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתָֽיִם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “between two saddlebags/loads.” or (2) “between the two parts of a sheep pen.” Both interpretations imply that the donkey is lying down to rest after it worked hard.

Also see how you translated “herd” in Gen 18:7-8, and how you translated “flock” in Gen 4:2, 4; 21:28; 27:9; 29:2-3, 6-10; 30:31, 32, 36, 38-43; 31:4, 8, 10, 12, 19, 38, 41, 43; 32:6; 37:2, 12, 14; 38:12, 13, 17; 46:34; 47:1, 17.

50:8	redu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עָזְב֖וּ	1	The children and animals were probably left with servants who took care of them during the funeral. For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in this sentence and say, “They left behind only their children and their livestock in Goshen Province.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “they left behind” or “were left behind with servants”
50:8	o9qv			בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ גֹּֽשֶׁן	1	Consider again how you translated “the land/region of Goshen” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 45:10; 46:28-29, 34; 47:1, 4, 6, 27; 50:8. Alternate translation: “in the region of Goshen.”

50:10	ipjy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֔ן וַ⁠יִּ֨סְפְּדוּ	1	For some languages it may be better to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “They traveled to the other side of the Jordan River and stopped at a grain threshing place owned by a man named Atad.” The location of Atad’s threshing floor is not certain. It was most likely on the west side of the Jordan River, since that is where the cave was located and that is where the Canaanites would have been most likely to observe Joseph’s family and the Egyptians mourning (verse 11). However, since its location is not certain, it is best to translate **beyond the Jordan** in a general way (like the Hebrew text is). Alternate translation: “which was located across the Jordan River,”
50:10	iieq			וַ⁠יִּ֨סְפְּדוּ שָׁ֔ם	1	 Alternate translation: “they began to mourn”

Alternate translation: “For seven days Joseph and the others grieved the death of his father.” or “and for seven days, Joseph led everyone in mourning the death of his father.”
50:11	zais			וַ⁠יַּ֡רְא יוֹשֵׁב֩ הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֜י אֶת הָ⁠אֵ֗בֶל בְּ⁠גֹ֨רֶן֙ הָֽאָטָ֔ד	1	See how you translated **threshing floor of Atad** in verse 10.

Alternate translation: “Wow! Those people of Egypt are mourning very sorrowfully for someone who died!”

50:11	b1sc			אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּ⁠עֵ֥בֶר	1	Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “which is located” or “The place is”
50:11	i2vy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠עֵ֥בֶר הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּֽן	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “That is why the name of that place on the other side of the Jordan River is Abel Mizraim, which means “Egyptians’ mourning place.”” Do what is best in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translate this phrase in verse 10.
50:12	je5d			צִוָּֽ⁠ם	1	 Alternate translation: “he had told them to do:”

Also be consistent with how you spelled the name of the man named Canaan in 9:18, 22, 25-27; 10:6, 15, and compare that to how you translated “the Canaanites” in 10:18-19; 12:6; 13:7; 15:21; 24:3, 37; 28:1, 6, 8; 34:30; 36:2; 38:2; 46:10; 50:11.

Be consistent with how you spelled **Ephron** in those verses and in Gen 23:8, 13-14, 16-17. Alternate translation: “It was the field and cave that Abraham had bought from Ephron the Hittite as a property to bury his dead relatives”
50:13	imrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל פְּנֵ֥י מַמְרֵֽא	1	For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence (after **Machpelah**) and say, “… the field of Machpelah near the city of Mamre. It was the field and cave that Abraham …” Do what is best in your language. Also, consider again how you translated **in front of Mamre** in the book of Genesis. See Gen 23:17, 19; 25:9; 49:30; 50:13. Be consistent with how you spelled **Mamre** in those verses and in Gen 13:18; 14:13, 24; 18:1.
